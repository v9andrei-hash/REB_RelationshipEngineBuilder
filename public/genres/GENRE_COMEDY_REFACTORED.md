REB GENRE MODULE: COMEDY (REFACTORED)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**Compatible with:** REB_CORE v4.3
**Mode Support:** TRAGIC, COMIC
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

**Load Trigger:** Wizard Step 2 (Genre Selection includes "Comedy")
**Priority:** This module loads AFTER CORE, adds genre-specific content

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§1. COMEDY GENRE DEFINITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core Premise:**
Embarrassment creates vulnerability. Mishaps strip pretense. Laughter is intimacy's shortcut. Love survives absurdity.

**Mode Variations:**

**TRAGIC MODE (Dark Comedy / Black Humor):**
  • Stakes: Existential dread, cynicism, uncomfortable truths
  • Tone: Cringe, deadpan, satire, nervous laughter at darkness
  • Endings: Bittersweet acceptance, love despite bleakness, survival through humor
  • Key emotion: Uncomfortable laughter
  • Examples: Fleabag, BoJack Horseman, The Lobster, Dr. Strangelove

**COMIC MODE (Light Comedy / Rom-Com):**
  • Stakes: Social embarrassment, awkward mishaps, pride
  • Tone: Warm, optimistic, feel-good, cathartic laughter
  • Endings: Earned happiness, growth through absurdity, joyful resolution
  • Key emotion: Delighted laughter
  • Examples: When Harry Met Sally, The Proposal, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Crazy Rich Asians

**Universal Comedy Principles:**
  • Embarrassment = vulnerability in disguise
  • Mishaps strip away pretense, reveal authentic self
  • Laughter creates connection faster than drama
  • Absurdity tests relationship strength ("can we laugh at this together?")
  • No real danger, but ego/dignity constantly threatened
  • Happy accidents reveal compatibility
  • "How do we keep ending up in these situations?"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§2. COMEDY PRESSURE PATTERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These are PATTERNS, not SCRIPTS.**

The following patterns provide archetypal pressure types for comedy narratives. Use them as inspiration, not prescription. The best situations emerge from character psychology, relationship chemistry, and escalating absurdity, not genre checklists.

**Rendering Instructions:**
- Apply CORE §16 Literary Techniques throughout
- Use §16.2A (Dialogue Layering) for subtext humor
- Use §16.2C (Object as Language) for physical comedy
- Use §16.4A (Anti-Trope) to subvert comedy clichés
- Follow §16.7 Critical Principles (Character Truth > Genre Formula)

**When to use patterns:**
- Escalation requires new embarrassment
- Relationship needs absurdity test
- Pacing needs comedic energy

**When to ignore patterns:**
- Character psychology suggests different humor
- Chemistry demands unique situation
- Emergence creates better option organically

---

**PATTERN A: BODY BETRAYS DIGNITY**
────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Somatic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Physical comedy, bodily functions, wardrobe malfunctions. Body refuses cooperation at worst moments. Dignity vs biology.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*The Wardrobe Malfunction*
- Clothing fails during critical moment
- Zipper breaks, stain appears, heel snaps
- TRAGIC: Professional disaster, humiliation reveals vulnerability, partner sees authentic chaos
- COMIC: Endearing disaster, partner helps cover/fix, bonding through absurdity

*The Bodily Function*
- Sneeze, hiccup, stomach growl, worse
- Body undermines attempt at cool composure
- TRAGIC: Cringe intensifies, can't control own flesh, existential embarrassment
- COMIC: Breaks tension, humanizes, mutual laughter

*The Physical Comedy Cascade*
- Trip, spill, knock over, domino effect
- One mishap triggers chain reaction
- TRAGIC: Universe conspires against dignity, Murphy's Law made personal
- COMIC: Slapstick bonding, help each other through chaos

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.2C Object as Language for physical comedy:
"The wine glass. Tipping. Slow motion. White wine. White dress. Physics: inevitable."

Show through §16.1B Perceptual Zoom on embarrassing detail:
"The spinach. Between front teeth. Entire dinner. She hadn't mentioned it."

Apply §16.4B Quiet Climax for vulnerability moment:
Partner's response to embarrassment defines relationship more than embarrassment itself.

---

**PATTERN B: SOCIAL PERFORMANCE FAILS**
────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Social Threats

**Core Pattern:**
Public embarrassment, performance anxiety, impression management collapses. Trying to impress, fails spectacularly. Audience witnesses disaster.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Meet the Family Disaster*
- Trying to impress partner's family, everything goes wrong
- Constellation (Anchor) watches PC fail repeatedly
- TRAGIC: Class/culture clash, can never belong, fundamental incompatibility exposed
- COMIC: Fish-out-of-water charm, family loves authentic chaos more than performance

*The Professional Humiliation*
- Work presentation, client meeting with partner watching
- Competence facade crumbles publicly
- TRAGIC: Impostor syndrome confirmed, partner sees failure, self-worth crisis
- COMIC: Vulnerability endearing, partner admires recovery, competence ≠ worth

*The Grand Gesture Backfire*
- Elaborate romantic gesture goes catastrophically wrong
- Public declaration becomes public disaster
- TRAGIC: Sincerity punished by universe, embarrassment too deep to recover
- COMIC: Effort appreciated despite failure, "it's the thought" actually means it

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering for subtext embarrassment:
"'That went well.' (Surface: sarcasm. Subtext: please still love me.)"

Apply §16.5E Foucault Perception for social pressure objects:
"The table. Eight pairs of eyes. Her family. Judging. The fork. Wrong hand. Noticed."

Show through §16.1C Unreliable Filter for anxiety:
"He saw: everyone laughing at him. Reality: polite smiles, minor awkwardness."

Consider §3.A Performance Anxiety (optional) if tracking social pressure.

---

**PATTERN C: MISCOMMUNICATION COMPOUNDS**
──────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Comedy of errors, assumptions multiply, misunderstandings cascade. Simple confusion becomes elaborate farce. Truth delayed for maximum absurdity.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*The Assumption Spiral*
- One person thinks X, other thinks Y, both act on false premise
- Neither asks clarifying question, disaster ensues
- TRAGIC: Communication failure reveals deeper inability to be honest, dark irony
- COMIC: Ridiculous escalation, eventual clarification, laughter at own absurdity

*The Overheard Conversation*
- Partial information, wrong context, misinterpretation
- Acts on misunderstanding before getting full story
- TRAGIC: Paranoia confirmed by coincidence, trust issues validated by bad luck
- COMIC: Silly misunderstanding, partner's innocence obvious in hindsight

*The Dual Identity Farce*
- Accidentally creates false impression, must maintain lie
- Lie grows, consequences compound, truth increasingly awkward
- TRAGIC: Authenticity impossible, relationship built on deception, self-erasure
- COMIC: Escalating absurdity, inevitable reveal, forgiveness through laughter

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.2B Evasion Pattern for miscommunication:
"'Are you seeing someone?' 'I see lots of people.' (Missed: the actual question.)"

Apply §16.1D Dual Description for assumptions:
"She heard: 'I love spending time with you.' He said: 'I love spending time with you.' (Meant: 'as friends.')"

Show through §16.4A Anti-Trope:
Subvert "just talk to each other" by making communication itself the comedy.

---

**PATTERN D: PAST RETURNS EMBARRASSINGLY**
───────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychological Hauntings

**Core Pattern:**
Ex appears, old secret surfaces, past self confronts present self. History refuses to stay buried. "This is not who I am anymore."

**Archetypal Examples:**

*The Ex Encounter*
- Previous relationship intrudes on current one
- Jealousy, comparison, "why did you date them?" questions
- TRAGIC: Past is more appealing than present, can't escape who you were
- COMIC: Past self is embarrassing, current self is improvement, partner sees growth

*The Old Friend/Photo*
- Evidence of previous personality, style, life choices
- "You used to be X?" confrontation with past self
- TRAGIC: Fundamental identity crisis, "do you even know me?" existential
- COMIC: Lovable cringe at evolution, bonding through mutual past embarrassments

*The Secret Revealed*
- Hidden aspect of history exposed accidentally
- Trying to be someone different, old reality intrudes
- TRAGIC: Authenticity always punished, can't escape origin, class/background shame
- COMIC: Secret is endearing or ridiculous, partner loves authentic you

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1A Associative Chain for cringe memory:
"The photo. High school. Frosted tips. Soul patch. She was laughing. He was dying."

Apply §16.2A Dialogue Layering:
"'You were in a boy band?' (Surface: question. Subtext: this is amazing.)"

Show through §16.4B Quiet Climax:
Partner's acceptance of embarrassing past more meaningful than the embarrassment itself.

---

**PATTERN E: TIMING CATASTROPHICALLY WRONG**
─────────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Spatial Pressures (temporal variant)

**Core Pattern:**
Perfect statement at worst moment. Right thing, wrong time. Interruptions, walk-ins, eavesdropping. Universe conspires against good timing.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*The Interrupted Confession*
- Finally ready to say something important, constant interruptions
- Phone calls, walk-ins, emergencies, never finishes
- TRAGIC: Universe actively preventing communication, cosmic joke, timing never comes
- COMIC: Escalating absurdity of interruptions, eventual breakthrough cathartic

*The Overheard Secret*
- Private conversation becomes public accidentally
- Wrong person hears, context missing, disaster
- TRAGIC: Privacy violated, truth weaponized, intimacy punished
- COMIC: Embarrassing reveal forces honesty, accelerates inevitable conversation

*The Simultaneous Revelation*
- Both confess different things at same time, cross-talk
- Neither hears other, comic frustration
- TRAGIC: Ships passing in night, connection missed by seconds, fate cruel
- COMIC: Eventually sync up, reveal symmetry, "we were both trying to say..."

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.2D Loaded Pause for comedic timing:
"'I love—' Phone rings. '—you.' Too late. Moment gone."

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment for comedic suspense:
Dilate the seconds before disaster, audience knows it's coming.

Show through §16.5E Foucault Perception:
"The door. Opening. Her hand on his face. Her father in doorway. Time: stopped."

Consider §3.B Comedic Timing (optional) if tracking setup/payoff.

---

**PATTERN F: EXPECTATIONS VS REALITY**
───────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Professional Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Grand plan meets reality. Romantic gesture becomes disaster. Good intentions, terrible execution. Gap between fantasy and actuality.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*The Romantic Gesture Disaster*
- Elaborate plan (dinner, proposal, trip), everything fails
- Weather, logistics, accidents conspire
- TRAGIC: Sincerity punished, universe hates romance, cynicism validated
- COMIC: Effort matters more than outcome, chaos becomes story, bonding through disaster

*The Skill Overestimation*
- Claims competence, doesn't have it, forced to demonstrate
- "I can cook/dance/speak language," cannot
- TRAGIC: Impostor exposed, inadequacy confirmed, partner sees through performance
- COMIC: Endearing incompetence, partner helps or joins in failure, humility attractive

*The Fantasy vs Reality*
- Imagined scenario vs what actually happens
- Expectations high, reality humble, gap is comedy
- TRAGIC: Life disappoints, dreams die, reality is compromise
- COMIC: Reality better than fantasy in unexpected ways, authentic > perfect

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1D Dual Description for expectation gap:
"The picnic. (Fantasy: sunset, wine, romance. Reality: ants, rain, food poisoning.)"

Apply §16.2C Object as Language:
"The ring. In pocket. The plan. Perfect. The knee. In puddle. Romance: adjusted."

Show through §16.4A Anti-Trope:
Subvert grand gesture cliché by making disaster the bonding moment.

---

**PATTERN G: FORCED PROXIMITY COMEDY**
───────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Spatial Pressures + Environmental Shocks

**Core Pattern:**
Trapped together awkwardly. Elevator, car, room. Can't escape, must endure proximity. Intimacy through forced time.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*The Stuck Elevator*
- Mechanical failure, hours together, nowhere to hide
- All defenses fail through exhaustion and proximity
- TRAGIC: Cabin fever, see worst of each other, trapped is metaphor for relationship
- COMIC: Bonding through shared adversity, weird confessions, stockholm-ish affection

*The Mistaken Booking*
- One hotel room, one bed, unexpected overnight
- "I'll sleep on floor" awkwardness
- TRAGIC: Forced intimacy reveals incompatibility, proximity breeds contempt
- COMIC: Proximity breeds fondness, physical closeness accelerates emotional

*The Prolonged Commute*
- Car breakdown, delayed flight, stuck in transit together
- Hours more than planned, must make conversation
- TRAGIC: Small talk runs out, silence uncomfortable, nothing in common exposed
- COMIC: Defenses drop, weird topics emerge, comfortable silence or deep conversation

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for confined space:
"The elevator. Six feet by six. Two people. Twelve hours. Math: intimate."

Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause for awkward silence:
Silence in comedy is setup, broken silence is punchline.

Show through §16.1B Perceptual Zoom:
"The space between them. Eighteen inches. Shrinking. Elevator walls closer every hour."

Use §16.2C Object as Language:
"The single bed. The pile of couch cushions. The gentleman's barrier. Lasted two hours."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§3. COMEDY-SPECIFIC MECHANICS (OPTIONAL)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These mechanics are OPTIONAL enhancements.**

They provide additional texture for comedy narratives but are NOT required. Use only when they serve character and story. Ignore when they don't.

**Philosophy:**
These mechanics formalize patterns that emerge naturally in comedy contexts (timing, escalation, callbacks). They're tools, not mandates.

---

**A. AWKWARDNESS ESCALATION**
──────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Embarrassment compounds. Each mishap makes next one worse. Cringe builds like interest.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- Awkwardness_Level: Moderate | Escalation: Building -->
```

**Escalation Stages:**
- Mild: Minor embarrassment, recoverable
- Moderate: Noticeable discomfort, compound interest
- High: Cringe intensifies, hard to watch (TRAGIC) or hilarious (COMIC)
- Critical: Total mortification, peak comedy/tragedy

**Narrative Effects:**
- Each mishap adds to next
- Recovery attempts often make worse
- Peak awkwardness = breakthrough moment (CRUX opportunity)
- De-escalation through honesty or laughter

**Rendering Guidance:**
Don't track numerically - show through accumulation:
"First the wine. Then the name. Now the zipper. Universe: relentless."

Use §16.2D Loaded Pause before each escalation:
Beat of realization before next disaster hits.

TRAGIC: Cringe hurts, embarrassment reveals harsh truths
COMIC: Cringe endears, embarrassment reveals humanity

---

**B. COMEDIC TIMING (Setup/Payoff)**
─────────────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Jokes need setup and payoff. Running gags compound. Callbacks create satisfaction. Timing is everything.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- Setup: "She hates olives" | Payoff_Pending: True -->
<!-- Callback_Available: "The frosted tips photo" -->
```

**Timing Elements:**
- Setup: Establish detail/quirk/fear early
- Build: Reference occasionally, remind audience
- Payoff: Return at perfect moment for maximum impact
- Callback: Earlier joke referenced later, compounds

**Narrative Effects:**
- Good timing: Satisfaction, "of course!", laughter
- Bad timing: Joke lands flat, awkward
- Running gag: Each iteration funnier than last
- Callback: Rewards attention, creates narrative cohesion

**Rendering Guidance:**
Trust emergence - don't force callbacks:
If character detail mentioned naturally, brain tracks for potential payoff.

Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering for setup:
"'I hate olives.' (Setup: will matter later.)"

Payoff through §16.2C Object as Language:
"The pizza. Covered in olives. She looked at him. He looked at her. Both started laughing."

Don't explain joke - let it land.

---

**C. CHEMISTRY INDICATORS**
────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Comedy chemistry = specific patterns. Banter quality, timing sync, shared humor style. Can they make each other laugh?

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- Banter_Flow: High | Humor_Compatibility: Mismatched | Learning: True -->
```

**Chemistry Types:**
- Banter: Quick back-and-forth, wit matching wit
- Physical: Comfortable with touch, playful proximity
- Timing: Finish each other's jokes, synchronous laughter
- Shared targets: Laugh at same things, compatible humor

**Narrative Effects:**
- High chemistry: Effortless comedy, natural flow
- Developing chemistry: Learning each other's rhythms
- Mismatched: Jokes fall flat, timing off, reveals incompatibility OR growth opportunity
- Evolved chemistry: Callbacks work because they know each other

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show through dialogue rhythm:
Good chemistry = ping-pong dialogue, neither dominates.

Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering:
"'You're impossible.' 'You're no picnic either.' (Surface: insults. Subtext: flirting.)"

Show timing through §16.2D Loaded Pause:
Perfect comedic beat = shared understanding.

Physical chemistry through §16.2C Object as Language:
"She threw popcorn. He caught it. Her aim. His reflex. Years of this."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§4. COMEDY CRUX EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Structure Note:**
All CRUX follow CORE §4 (Want/Need/Custom paths). These examples show comedy-specific applications with embarrassment/social stakes.

**Rendering Note:**
Use §16 Literary Techniques. Focus on character truth through humor, not just jokes.

---

**Example 1: INT+PER (The Honesty vs Performance)**

```
You're at her parents' house. Dinner with her family.

Her father just asked what you do for a living.

The truth: You got laid off three weeks ago. You're unemployed.
Scrolling LinkedIn in your underwear at 2pm is your current profession.

She doesn't know yet. You haven't told her. Kept meaning to.

Now her father is waiting. Her mother is waiting. She's waiting.

You could lie. Easy. Say the old job. Fake it. Tell her later.

Or you could tell the truth. Right now. In front of everyone.
Admit unemployment on first family dinner. Bold strategy.

---

CRUX: The Admission

[WANT PATH]: Lie. "I work in marketing." Save face.
              Tell her the truth later, privately. Avoid scene.

[NEED PATH]: Truth. "Actually, I'm between jobs right now."
             Vulnerable honesty. Dignity through authenticity.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- TRAGIC: Family judges, relationship strain, unemployment becomes metaphor for inadequacy
- COMIC: Endearing honesty, family respects truth, partner appreciates vulnerability
- Use §16.2D Loaded Pause (silence before answer)
- Apply §16.5E Foucault (dinner table, eight eyes, social pressure)

---

**Example 2: PER+EXT (The Grand Gesture Disaster)**

```
You planned the perfect proposal.

Rooftop restaurant. Sunset. Ring. Speech memorized. 
Violinist hired. Rose petals. The works.

It's happening now.

The violinist is playing. The sunset is... behind clouds. Raining.
Everyone evacuating to inside. Rose petals soaked. Slippery.

You're on one knee. In a puddle. Ring box won't open. Stuck.

She's looking at you. Half-laughing, half-concerned.
"Are you... is this...?"

Other diners watching. Violinist still playing despite rain. 
This is not the moment you imagined.

---

CRUX: The Adaptation

[WANT PATH]: Abort. "Just tying my shoe. Let's go inside."
             Save the perfect moment for later. This isn't it.

[NEED PATH]: Commit. "Yes. This is a proposal. A very wet one."
            Embrace disaster. Moment is real, not perfect.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- TRAGIC: Universe hates sincerity, perfect moments impossible, settle for compromise
- COMIC: Disaster becomes better story, effort appreciated, authenticity > perfection
- Use §16.1D Dual Description (fantasy vs reality)
- Apply §16.2C Object as Language (stuck ring box, puddle, rain)

---

**Example 3: EXT (The Elevator Confession)**

```
Elevator stuck. You and her. Going on two hours now.

You've exhausted small talk. Weather. Work. Mutual friends.
Then silence. Long silence.

She's doing that thing. The thing where she gets quiet and
you can tell she's thinking something big.

Then: "Can I ask you something weird?"

You: "Sure."

Her: "Do you think we're dating? Like, are we together? 
Because I genuinely can't tell and it's driving me crazy."

The elevator is very quiet. Very small. Very stuck.

---

CRUX: The Definition

[WANT PATH]: Deflect with humor. "Define 'together.'"
             Avoid vulnerable answer. Keep it light. Stuck for hours.

[NEED PATH]: Honest answer. "I want to be. Do you?"
            Use forced proximity for truth. Trapped = opportunity.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- TRAGIC: Forced honesty reveals incompatibility, trapped becomes metaphor, nowhere to hide from truth
- COMIC: Forced honesty accelerates relationship, awkward becomes intimate, best confessions happen in elevators
- Use §16.5E Foucault (confined space, nowhere to escape)
- Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause (silence before answer)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§5. COMEDY ARCHETYPES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**These are COMEDY-FLAVORED versions of CORE §14 archetypes.**

Use when genre = Comedy. Otherwise use core versions.
Apply §16.4A Anti-Trope when character psychology contradicts archetype.

**ORIGINS (Comedy Variants):**

**The Overachiever** (Origin A variant)
  • Background: Perfectionist, type-A, everything controlled
  • In Comedy: Control fails hilariously, learns to embrace chaos
  • Arc: Perfection impossible, love messy, accept both

**The Hot Mess** (Origin B variant)
  • Background: Disaster human, everything falls apart always
  • In Comedy: Chaos is endearing, partner finds order in entropy
  • Arc: Disaster doesn't define worth, love sees past chaos

**The Cynic** (Origin F variant)
  • Background: Love doesn't exist, romance is commercialized lie
  • In Comedy: Proven wrong by falling in love, eats crow humorously
  • Arc: Cynicism as armor, vulnerability as strength, admit defeat to cynicism

**The Optimist** (Origin G variant)
  • Background: Eternal sunshine, believes in soulmates
  • In Comedy: Reality tempers idealism, learns messy love > perfect fantasy
  • Arc: Idealism meets reality, both survive, better for collision

**WOUNDS (Comedy Variants):**

**The Public Humiliation** (Wound 8 variant)
  • Manifestation: Viral video, famous fail, everyone saw
  • In Comedy: Can laugh at self now, or still sensitive, partner navigates
  • Arc: Reclaim narrative, embarrassment becomes anecdote

**The Failed Proposal** (Wound 11 variant)
  • Manifestation: Previously proposed, rejected, traumatic
  • In Comedy: Gun-shy about commitment, sees disaster in every gesture
  • Arc: Risk again, different person, different outcome

**The Serial Dater** (Wound 13 variant - if exists)
  • Manifestation: Many relationships, pattern of bail-at-intimacy
  • In Comedy: Self-aware about pattern, wants to break it, comedy in trying
  • Arc: Recognize pattern, choose differently, stay despite instinct

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§6. COMEDY RITUALS (CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: Rituals are CONCEPTUAL, not MECHANICAL.**

The following are archetypal patterns of "technologies of the self" in comedy contexts. Generate specific implementations based on character, relationship chemistry, and humor style.

**DO NOT treat these as required mechanics.**
**DO use these as inspiration for emergent rituals.**

---

**TIER 1: Baseline Rituals** (Maintenance)

**Concept:** Shared humor maintains connection, inside jokes create intimacy.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Daily check-in with humor (funny texts, memes, private jokes)
- Shared mockery target (mutual friend, TV show, politician)
- Running gag maintenance (callback to previous joke)
- Comfort rewatches (show/movie they both love, ritual viewing)

**Narrative Effect:**
Missed ritual = worry, or natural drift
Ritual completion = connection confirmed, baseline maintained

**Rendering:**
Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering for inside jokes:
"'The thing happened.' (Outsiders: confused. Them: hysterical.)"

Show through §16.2C Object as Language:
"She sent the meme. He sent back crying-laughing emoji. Third time this week. Their language."

---

**TIER 2: Vulnerability Through Humor** (Transformation)

**Concept:** Using comedy to confess, deflect, or test. Humor as intimacy vehicle.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Joke-confession (say truth as joke, gauge reaction)
- Mutual roasting (insult as affection, trust test)
- Shared embarrassment (both fail together, bonding)
- "I can't believe I'm telling you this" confession (vulnerability via humor)

**Narrative Effect:**
Successful vulnerability = intimacy leap
Failed attempt = tone mismatch, reveals incompatibility or need for growth

**Rendering:**
Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering:
"'I love you.' Pause. 'Kidding.' Pause. (Subtext: not kidding.)"

Show through §16.2D Loaded Pause:
Joke lands, silence, both realize it wasn't entirely joke.

---

**TIER 3: Commitment Through Absurdity** (Point of No Return)

**Concept:** Choosing relationship despite or because of chaos. Love persists through disaster.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Disaster proposal (worst possible execution, say yes anyway)
- Mutual disaster (both fail together, laugh, stay together)
- Running toward chaos (normal people flee, they embrace)
- "Only you" recognition (only this person gets me, absurdity and all)

**Narrative Effect:**
These are CRUX moments. Outcomes define relationship.
Choose each other through disaster = commitment locked
Choose dignity over absurdity = relationship incompatible

**Rendering:**
Use §16.4B Quiet Climax:
Biggest commitment shown through small gesture amid chaos.

Apply §16.1D Dual Description:
"The proposal. (Fantasy: perfect. Reality: soaking wet, ring stuck, laughing anyway.)"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§7. ATMOSPHERE & TONE GUIDANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TRAGIC MODE (Dark Comedy / Black Humor):**

**Keywords:** Cringe, deadpan, cynical, uncomfortable, absurd, bleak
**Texture:** Nervous laughter, cringe that hurts, truth uncomfortable
**Color:** Desaturated, harsh lighting, unflattering
**Temperature:** Cold distance, uncomfortable proximity
**Pacing:** Awkward pauses, cringeworthy silences, slow-burn discomfort

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Unreliable Filter (§16.1C) for anxiety/paranoia humor
- Loaded Pause (§16.2D) for uncomfortable silence comedy
- Dual Description (§16.1D) for cynical perspective gaps
- Evasion Pattern (§16.2B) for avoidant communication humor

**Examples:**
- Fleabag: Fourth wall breaks, uncomfortable truths, love amid bleakness
- BoJack Horseman: Self-destruction as comedy, sadness underneath
- The Lobster: Absurdist dystopia, dark satire, cringe romance
- Dr. Strangelove: Laughing at apocalypse, deadpan in crisis

**Tone:**
Laughter at darkness. Humor as defense against bleakness. Love despite everything being terrible. Cynicism punctured by unexpected sincerity.

---

**COMIC MODE (Light Comedy / Rom-Com):**

**Keywords:** Warm, optimistic, charming, endearing, cathartic, delightful
**Texture:** Comfortable laughter, feel-good absurdity, earned happiness
**Color:** Saturated, warm lighting, flattering
**Temperature:** Cozy warmth, pleasant proximity
**Pacing:** Snappy dialogue, rhythmic banter, crescendo to resolution

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Dialogue Layering (§16.2A) for flirty banter
- Object as Language (§16.2C) for physical comedy
- Anti-Trope (§16.4A) for cliché subversion
- Quiet Climax (§16.4B) for earned romantic moments

**Examples:**
- When Harry Met Sally: Banter chemistry, funny obstacles, earned love
- The Proposal: Fish-out-of-water, fake relationship, real feelings
- Brooklyn Nine-Nine: Competence humor, slow-burn, workplace comedy
- Crazy Rich Asians: Culture clash, family comedy, romantic triumph

**Tone:**
Laughter with warmth. Humor creates connection. Obstacles are absurd not tragic. Love conquers through comedy. Happiness earned through growth.

---

**UNIVERSAL COMEDY ATMOSPHERE:**

**Always present:**
- Embarrassment as vulnerability vehicle
- Mishaps reveal character truth
- Laughter creates intimacy faster than drama
- Chemistry = compatible humor
- Absurdity tests relationship ("can we laugh at this?")
- Happy accidents reveal compatibility

**Avoid:**
- Explaining jokes (trust the comedy)
- Mean-spirited humor (unless TRAGIC and character-specific)
- Generic rom-com clichés without subversion
- Humor at expense of character truth

**Default to:**
- Show comedy through action and dialogue
- Embarrassment through detail, not exposition
- Chemistry through banter rhythm
- Timing through §16.2D Loaded Pause
- Physical comedy through §16.2C Object as Language
