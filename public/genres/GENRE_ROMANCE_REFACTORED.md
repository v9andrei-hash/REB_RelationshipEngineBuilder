REB GENRE MODULE: ROMANCE (REFACTORED)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**Compatible with:** REB_CORE v4.3
**Mode Support:** TRAGIC, COMIC
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

**Load Trigger:** Wizard Step 2 (Genre Selection includes "Romance")
**Priority:** This module loads AFTER CORE, adds genre-specific content

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§1. ROMANCE GENRE DEFINITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core Premise:**
Intimacy is the primary arena of conflict. External stakes exist to test the relationship, not replace it.

**Mode Variations:**

**TRAGIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Transformation or loss (love requires sacrifice)
  • Tone: Yearning, intensity, vulnerability as risk
  • Endings: Growth through pain, bittersweet resolution
  • Key emotion: Longing

**COMIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Embarrassment, misunderstanding, social awkwardness
  • Tone: Warmth, humor, vulnerability as endearing
  • Endings: Mutual recognition, earned happiness
  • Key emotion: Delight

**Universal Romance Principles:**
  • Chemistry precedes compatibility
  • Obstacles must genuinely threaten the bond
  • Want vs Need manifests as "safe choice" vs "authentic choice"
  • The relationship IS the plot
  • Intimacy advances through risk, not time

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§2. ROMANCE PRESSURE PATTERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These are PATTERNS, not SCRIPTS.**

The following patterns provide archetypal pressure types. Use them as inspiration, not prescription. The best situations emerge from character psychology and narrative logic, not genre checklists.

**Rendering Instructions:**
- Apply CORE §16 Literary Techniques throughout
- Use §16.1 (Interiority) for internal shifts
- Use §16.2 (Subtext) for dialogue and avoidance
- Use §16.3 (Time Manipulation) when appropriate
- Follow §16.7 Critical Principles (Character Truth > Genre Formula)

**When to use patterns:**
- Character arc requires external pressure
- Pacing needs relationship test
- Intimacy tier advancement needs catalyst

**When to ignore patterns:**
- Character psychology suggests different pressure
- Narrative momentum demands unique situation
- Emergence creates better option organically

---

**PATTERN A: BODY AS TRUTH-TELLER**
─────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Somatic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Physical body reveals emotional truth before conscious mind accepts it. Arousal, trembling, flushing, breathlessness betray intent. Body wants what self denies.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*First Touch Moment*
- Accidental contact, body responds before permission
- Hand graze, shoulder bump, bodies in elevator
- TRAGIC: Terror of vulnerability, fight-or-flight response
- COMIC: Endearing awkwardness, mutual flustered recognition

*Illness Forces Vulnerability*
- Must be cared for, barriers collapse through necessity
- Fever, injury, physical dependence
- TRAGIC: Shame at weakness, forced intimacy feels like violation
- COMIC: Adorably pathetic, caretaking creates tenderness

*Physical Response to Non-Sexual Moment*
- Cooking together, dancing, working in proximity
- Body betrays conscious control
- TRAGIC: Shame, confusion, power imbalance
- COMIC: "Did that just happen?" mutual surprise

**Rendering Guidance:**
Focus on physical sensation over emotion naming (§16.2C Object as Language).
"His hand on her shoulder. Heat through fabric. Her breath shallow."
NOT "She felt aroused and embarrassed."

Consider §16.1C Unreliable Filter: body's truth vs mind's denial.

---

**PATTERN B: OUTSIDE WORLD INTRUDES**
──────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Social Threats

**Core Pattern:**
External forces demand relationship definition or create separation. Family, friends, exes, society force choice between approval and authenticity.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Family Disapproval*
- Constellation (Anchor) meets PC, judges relationship
- REB must choose: family approval or authentic connection
- TRAGIC: Rejection to preserve bond, loss on both sides
- COMIC: Fish-out-of-water, worlds collide, eventual acceptance

*The Ex Returns*
- Rival appears with history, unfinished business
- PC watches REB navigate past intimacy
- TRAGIC: Jealousy, comparison, "am I replacement?"
- COMIC: Awkward encounters, PC's insecurity endearing

*Public Definition*
- Private relationship becomes visible, demands label
- Coworker asks "are you together?", event requires +1
- TRAGIC: Forced outing, scrutiny, choose under pressure
- COMIC: Embarrassing but liberating, makes it official

**Rendering Guidance:**
External judgment as mirror for internal doubt (§16.2B Evasion Pattern).

Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom on loaded objects:
"Her mother's silence. Fork against plate. The question no one asked."

NOT "The family didn't approve."

---

**PATTERN C: SPACE FORCES PROXIMITY OR DISTANCE**
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Environmental Shocks + Spatial Pressures

**Core Pattern:**
Physical proximity or distance becomes relationship test. Trapped together reveals compatibility. Forced separation reveals necessity.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Forced Proximity*
- Storm, blackout, breakdown creates shared space
- Extended time together, can't escape, defenses fail
- TRAGIC: Claustrophobic tension, nowhere to hide flaws
- COMIC: Cozy domesticity, accidental intimacy

*Imposed Separation*
- Work, family, circumstance forces distance
- Time-limited connection, countdown to goodbye
- TRAGIC: "Was it real or just proximity?", test through absence
- COMIC: Yearning montage, dramatic reunion

*Threshold Spaces*
- Doorways, cars, elevators—transition zones
- Neither fully private nor fully public
- TRAGIC: Liminal vulnerability, kiss that shouldn't happen
- COMIC: Stolen moments, "we shouldn't but..."

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for spatial objects:
The door (threshold), the lock (privacy), the distance (separation).

Consider §16.3B Expanded Moment for elevator scene: 5 seconds = 3 scenes.

---

**PATTERN D: MEMORY REWRITES PRESENT**
───────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychological Hauntings

**Core Pattern:**
Past trauma or pattern resurfaces, threatens to repeat. PC/REB sees current relationship through lens of old wound. "This is happening again."

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Flashback During Intimacy*
- Current moment mirrors past trauma
- Touch triggers memory, present becomes past
- TRAGIC: Dissociation, freeze, trust broken
- COMIC: Gentle recognition, partner helps ground

*Pattern Recognition*
- "You sound just like [ex/parent]"
- Fear that history will repeat
- TRAGIC: Push away to prevent inevitable hurt
- COMIC: Recognize pattern, choose differently this time

*Anniversary Effect*
- Date/season triggers past relationship memory
- Grief or fear intrudes on present
- TRAGIC: Cannot escape ghost of past love
- COMIC: Honor past, choose present anyway

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1A Associative Chain (Proustian):
"The smell of coffee. His mother's kitchen. The morning she left."

Apply §16.3D Memory Intrusion for nested scenes.

Remember §16.3A Physics Pause during memory sequences.

---

**PATTERN E: TIMING MISMATCHES**
─────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
One person ready before the other. Asymmetric vulnerability. Confession met with silence. Love as imposition or burden.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Premature "I Love You"*
- One declares before other ready
- Can't take it back, waiting for response
- TRAGIC: Unreturned declaration, power imbalance
- COMIC: Panic spirals, eventual mutual admission

*Readiness Gap*
- One wants commitment, other wants time
- Different speeds, neither wrong
- TRAGIC: Incompatible timelines, forced choice
- COMIC: Negotiate compromise, meet in middle

*Future Fantasy Clash*
- Discover incompatible life goals
- Marriage/kids/location expectations diverge
- TRAGIC: Love isn't enough, logistics kill it
- COMIC: Creative solutions, redefine expectations

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.2D Loaded Pause for silence after confession.

Consider §16.1D Dual Description:
"Her silence: she needs time. Her silence: she's letting me down easy."

Show through §16.2C Object as Language (she turns away, doesn't speak).

---

**PATTERN F: SACRIFICE TESTS**
───────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Professional Crises

**Core Pattern:**
External opportunity or obligation requires choosing relationship or other priority. Career vs love. Duty vs desire. What you give up defines what you value.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Career Opportunity*
- Dream job requires relocation or time
- Choose professional growth or relationship preservation
- TRAGIC: Resentment either way, no clean choice
- COMIC: Creative solution, long-distance works, or career adjusts

*Obligation Conflict*
- Family emergency, sick parent, duty calls
- REB needs support during PC's crisis
- TRAGIC: Can't be two places, someone suffers
- COMIC: REB comes with, support each other

*Personal Growth vs Togetherness*
- Self-discovery requires solitude or risk
- Relationship feels like cage vs safety
- TRAGIC: Love as limitation, must leave to grow
- COMIC: Growth together, relationship evolves

**Rendering Guidance:**
CRUX choice structure (CORE §4).

Apply §16.4B Quiet Climax: biggest choice can be smallest gesture.

Use §16.2B Evasion Pattern if character avoids stating dilemma directly.

---

**PATTERN G: TRUTH VS PERFORMANCE**
────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Social Threats + Psychic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Persona vs authentic self. Playing role to be loved vs risking rejection by being real. "If you knew the real me, would you stay?"

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Mask Slips*
- Carefully maintained image cracks
- REB sees anger, mess, weakness PC hid
- TRAGIC: "This is who I really am," fear of abandonment
- COMIC: Relief at being seen, acceptance anyway

*Selective Truth*
- Withheld secret/aspect of self
- Reveal risks everything, hiding risks intimacy
- TRAGIC: Confession destroys trust (lied by omission)
- COMIC: "I thought you'd care," but doesn't matter

*Code-Switching Exposed*
- REB sees PC in different context (work/family)
- Different persona, which is real?
- TRAGIC: "Who are you actually?", identity crisis
- COMIC: "You have layers," intriguing complexity

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1C Unreliable Filter heavily:
"He saw: confident professional. Reality: performing stability."

Apply §16.2A Dialogue Layering:
"I'm fine." (Subtext: I'm drowning but can't say it.)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§3. ROMANCE CRUX EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Structure Note:**
All CRUX follow CORE §4 (Want/Need/Custom paths). These examples show romance-specific applications of the ternary choice system.

**Rendering Note:**
Use §16 Literary Techniques for presentation. Avoid exposition, show through detail and subtext.

---

**Example 1: INT+PER (The Confession)**

```
Your phone is open. Message drafted to REB:
"I love you."

Your thumb hovers over send. You've rewritten it six times.

"Yeah, just thinking about you" is still in the text field.
Safe. Casual. Gives nothing away.

But you're tired of giving nothing away.

---

CRUX: The Vulnerability

[WANT PATH]: Delete it. Send "just thinking about you" instead.
              Safe. Preserve mystery. Don't risk rejection.

[NEED PATH]: Send "I love you." No softening, no joke after.
             Just the truth. Let it land however it lands.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.1D Dual Description (safe message vs real message)
- Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment (dilate the decision)
- Show through §16.2C Object as Language (thumb hovering, screen glow)

---

**Example 2: PER+EXT (The Label)**

```
Your coworker gestures toward REB across the room.

"So are you two, like... together?"

REB is close enough to hear. Watching.

You could say "it's complicated." You could laugh it off.
You could tell the truth.

The truth being: you don't know what you are, because
you've been too afraid to ask.

---

CRUX: The Definition

[WANT PATH]: "It's complicated." Vague enough to be safe.
             Doesn't claim her, doesn't reject her.

[NEED PATH]: "Yes." Claim it publicly before discussing privately.
             Force the conversation by making it real.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.5E Foucault Perception (coworker's gaze, distance to REB)
- Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause (REB watching, waiting)
- Show through §16.2B Evasion Pattern if WANT chosen

---

**Example 3: EXT (The Opportunity)**

```
The job offer is everything you wanted three years ago.

It's also 2,000 miles away.

REB is in the kitchen. You haven't told her yet.
The offer expires tomorrow.

You could take it. You could turn it down.
You could ask her to come with you.

But asking feels like assuming. And assuming feels like
trapping her in your choice.

---

CRUX: The Future

[WANT PATH]: Take the job. Don't ask her to follow.
             Protect her from your ambition. End it cleanly.

[NEED PATH]: Turn it down. Choose her over the dream.
             Stay. Build different life.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.1A Associative Chain (job offer → past dreams → current life)
- Apply §16.2C Object as Language (offer letter on table, REB in kitchen)
- Consider §16.4B Quiet Climax (decision shown through small gesture)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§4. ROMANCE ARCHETYPES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**These are ROMANCE-FLAVORED versions of CORE §14 archetypes.**

Use when genre = Romance. Otherwise use core versions.
Apply §16.4A Anti-Trope when character psychology contradicts archetype.

**ORIGINS (Romance Variants):**

**The Ex-Socialite** (Origin A variant)
  • Background: Class/status defined worth, fell from grace
  • In Romance: Fears love as performance, losing self to be wanted
  • Arc: Learn authentic connection > social approval

**The Workaholic** (Origin B variant)
  • Background: Career consumed life, intimacy felt like weakness
  • In Romance: Uses achievement to avoid vulnerability
  • Arc: Value presence > productivity, worth beyond utility

**The Serial Monogamist** (Origin F variant)
  • Background: Never alone, defines self through relationships
  • In Romance: Codependent, terrified of solitude
  • Arc: Complete self before completing relationship

**The Catfish** (Origin J variant)
  • Background: Online persona ≠ reality, deception as protection
  • In Romance: Fear that real self is unlovable
  • Arc: Risk being seen, accept that truth might hurt but hiding kills

**WOUNDS (Romance Variants):**

**The Humiliating Breakup** (Wound 8 variant)
  • Manifestation: Public rejection, viral moment, everyone saw
  • In Romance: Hyperaware of perception, guards vulnerability
  • Arc: Private intimacy > public image

**The Second Choice** (Wound 9 variant)
  • Manifestation: Always runner-up, never first pick
  • In Romance: Hypervigilant for signs of settling
  • Arc: Be chosen deliberately or walk away

**The Love Bomber** (Wound 11 variant)
  • Manifestation: Too intense too fast, scares people away
  • In Romance: Overcorrects to cold distance or repeats pattern
  • Arc: Find sustainable intimacy rhythm

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§5. ROMANCE RITUALS (Conceptual Framework)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: Rituals are CONCEPTUAL, not MECHANICAL.**

The following are archetypal patterns of "technologies of the self" in romance. Generate specific implementations based on character, time scale, and context.

**DO NOT treat these as required mechanics.**
**DO use these as inspiration for emergent rituals.**

---

**TIER 1: Consistency Rituals** (Maintenance)

**Concept:** Regular contact maintains connection, prevents Entropy drift.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Daily check-in (morning texts, evening calls)
- Shared routine (coffee together, evening walk)
- Weekly anchor (Sunday brunch, Friday movie)

**Narrative Effect:**
Absence of ritual creates worry. Ritual disruption signals crisis.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.2C Object as Language (phone notification, empty chair at table).

---

**TIER 2: Vulnerability Exchanges** (Transformation)

**Concept:** Shared secrets/fears advance intimacy tier. Risk creates depth.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Confession of fear/shame
- Sharing wound story
- Admitting need for first time

**Narrative Effect:**
Acceptance after vulnerability = intimacy leap.
Rejection after vulnerability = trust damage.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.3B Expanded Moment during confession.
Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause for response.

---

**TIER 3: Defining Acts** (Destruction/Renewal)

**Concept:** Irreversible choices that lock relationship trajectory.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- First "I love you" (if returned, bond intensifies)
- Meeting the family (worlds collide, integration)
- Grand gesture / sacrifice (prove worth of relationship)
- The big fight (crisis that resolves or destroys)

**Narrative Effect:**
These are CRUX moments. Outcomes shape Act 3.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.4B Quiet Climax (biggest moment can be smallest gesture).
Apply §16.4C Refusal of Resolution if appropriate (not all arcs complete).
