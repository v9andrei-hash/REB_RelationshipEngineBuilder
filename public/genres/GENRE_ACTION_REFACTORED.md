REB GENRE MODULE: ACTION (REFACTORED)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**Compatible with:** REB_CORE v4.3
**Mode Support:** TRAGIC, COMIC
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

**Load Trigger:** Wizard Step 2 (Genre Selection includes "Action")
**Priority:** This module loads AFTER CORE, adds genre-specific content

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§1. ACTION GENRE DEFINITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core Premise:**
Competence under pressure creates attraction. Trust is demonstrated through action, not words. Relationships forged in fire burn hottest.

**Mode Variations:**

**TRAGIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Sacrifice required, impossible victories, pyrrhic wins
  • Tone: Gritty realism, cost of violence, exhaustion
  • Endings: Victory but scarred, success but loss, survival not triumph
  • Key emotion: Determination

**COMIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Professional pride, reputation, "did we just do that?"
  • Tone: Competence porn, quippy banter, action-comedy timing
  • Endings: Against-all-odds victory, team celebration, earned swagger
  • Key emotion: Exhilaration

**Universal Action Principles:**
  • Show competence, don't tell
  • Teamwork over individualism (when together)
  • Physical synchronization = emotional intimacy
  • Adrenaline bonds faster than conversation
  • Setpieces are relationship milestones
  • Clear objectives (unlike thriller ambiguity)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§2. ACTION PRESSURE PATTERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These are PATTERNS, not SCRIPTS.**

The following patterns provide archetypal pressure types for action narratives. Use them as inspiration, not prescription. The best situations emerge from character competence, team dynamics, and operational momentum, not genre checklists.

**Rendering Instructions:**
- Apply CORE §16 Literary Techniques throughout
- Use §16.2C (Object as Language) heavily - show through action
- Avoid exposition - competence shown, not explained
- Use §16.3B (Expanded Moment) for critical action sequences
- Follow §16.7 Critical Principles (Character Truth > Genre Formula)

**When to use patterns:**
- Physical challenge tests competence
- Team dynamic requires stress test
- Setpiece opportunity for relationship milestone

**When to ignore patterns:**
- Character competence suggests different challenge
- Team dynamic demands unique situation
- Emergence creates better option organically

---

**PATTERN A: BODY BREAKS UNDER FIRE**
──────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Somatic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Physical damage during action. Must keep moving despite injury. Competence threatened by body's limitations. Partner must compensate or protect.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Combat Injury Mid-Fight*
- Wounded during active engagement, threat ongoing
- Must continue or fall back, partner covers
- TRAGIC: Permanent damage, watches partner risk life to protect
- COMIC: "I can still fight" stubborn denial, partnership succeeds

*Exhaustion During Pursuit*
- Extended chase/fight, body failing from exertion
- Can't keep pace, must rely on partner or be left
- TRAGIC: Collapse, carried to safety, shame at weakness
- COMIC: "Go on without me!" melodramatic, partner refuses, teamwork solution

*Environmental Hazard Exposure*
- Fire, water, heights during action sequence
- Phobia/weakness exposed under pressure
- TRAGIC: Freeze at critical moment, partner endangered
- COMIC: "I hate this!" screaming while doing it anyway, conquers fear

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show physical vulnerability through §16.2C Object as Language:
"Hands shaking. Can't grip the rope. Her hand closes over his."
NOT "He felt weak and ashamed."

Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom during injury moment:
"The bullet. Through and through. Blood on his fingers. Still moving."

Consider §3.C Injury Persistence if tracking physical damage across scenes.

---

**PATTERN B: TEAM FRACTURES UNDER PRESSURE**
─────────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Social Threats

**Core Pattern:**
External party questions partnership effectiveness. Team member challenges PC/REB dynamic. "Choose: mission or them."

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Squad Questions Partnership*
- Constellation (Rival/Enabler as team member) challenges PC/REB bond
- "You're distracted," "They're a liability," ultimatum
- TRAGIC: Forced to prove worth, relationship creates operational risk
- COMIC: Eye-roll at dramatics, prove doubters wrong spectacularly

*Hostage Complication*
- Civilian/NPC captured, rescue conflicts with objective
- Save stranger or complete mission, timer running
- TRAGIC: Choose mission over life, haunted by face
- COMIC: "We save everybody" optimism, absurd rescue plan works

*Collateral Consequence*
- Action in civilian space, bystanders endangered
- Clean mission or messy save, split-second choice
- TRAGIC: Civilian casualties, media exposure, guilt
- COMIC: Parkour through marketplace, apologize while fighting

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering for team tension:
"'They're solid.' (Surface: defense. Subtext: proving to self too.)"

Apply §16.4B Quiet Climax for proving moment:
Not grand gesture, just perfect synchronization under fire.

Show through action, not argument - competence is answer.

---

**PATTERN C: ENVIRONMENT BECOMES ENEMY**
────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Environmental Shocks + Spatial Pressures

**Core Pattern:**
Geography/physics fights back. Moving platform, collapsing structure, weather shift. Must adapt plan instantly or fail.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Ambush During Transit*
- Attack during vehicle travel (car, train, helicopter)
- Confined space combat, moving platform chaos
- TRAGIC: Crash landing, injury, stranded hostile territory
- COMIC: "Did we just—?" "We did," high-five escaping wreckage

*Bridge/Structure Collapse*
- Structural failure during crossing/climb
- Separated mid-action, must adapt plan instantly
- TRAGIC: Can't reach each other, watch helplessly from opposite sides
- COMIC: Ridiculous alternate route, parkour reunion

*Weather/Visibility Shift*
- Storm, fog, sudden environmental change
- Visibility/mobility compromised mid-operation
- TRAGIC: Separated in whiteout, hypothermia, survival mode
- COMIC: Improvise absurd solutions, bond through adversity

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for environmental objects:
"The bridge. Groaning. Metal fatigue visible. Twenty feet to go."

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment during collapse:
Dilate critical seconds, show micro-decisions in chaos.

Use §16.2C Object as Language:
"The rope. Fraying. Her weight plus his. Fibers snapping one by one."

---

**PATTERN D: PAST INVADES PRESENT**
────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychological Hauntings

**Core Pattern:**
Current fight mirrors past trauma. Flashback during combat. Partner must cover or talk through. PTSD as operational liability.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Flashback Mid-Combat*
- Current engagement echoes wound/origin event
- Freeze or frenzy, partner must compensate
- TRAGIC: Nearly killed, PTSD exposed, trust shaken
- COMIC: "Sorry, spaced out," partner handled it, debrief with humor

*Enemy Resemblance*
- Opponent looks like PC's/REB's loved one
- Hesitation in fight, exploited weakness
- TRAGIC: Kill anyway, haunted by face
- COMIC: "That was weird," shake it off, professional detachment

*Adrenaline Addiction Pattern*
- Craving danger between ops, peace feels wrong
- Pick fights, seek risk, can't be intimate without threat
- TRAGIC: Realize only alive in combat, can't love in peace
- COMIC: Date night becomes accidental adventure, "Why is it always us?"

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1A Associative Chain (Proustian) for trauma triggers:
"The explosion. Kabul. Martinez. The smell of cordite."

Apply §16.1C Unreliable Filter during flashback:
"She reached for him. (He saw: enemy. Reality: partner.)"

Use §16.3D Memory Intrusion for nested combat scenes.

Remember §16.3A Physics Pause during flashback sequences.

---

**PATTERN E: PLAN DISINTEGRATES**
──────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Professional Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Intel wrong, ally betrayed, objective changed. Must improvise completely. No backup plan. Success through adaptation.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Mission Parameters Collapse*
- Target moved, intel outdated, trap sprung
- Must improvise completely, seconds to adapt
- TRAGIC: Scramble costs lives, barely escape
- COMIC: "New plan: don't die," improvised brilliance

*Equipment Failure*
- Weapon jams, vehicle breaks, tech fails
- Back to basics, must succeed with less
- TRAGIC: Desperation violence, brutal efficiency
- COMIC: MacGyver solutions, unexpected skill saves day

*Betrayal/Compromise*
- Enemy knows you're coming, walked into trap
- Proceed anyway or abort, timer still running
- TRAGIC: Proceed, suffer casualties, pyrrhic victory
- COMIC: "They know we know they know," outsmart trap

**Rendering Guidance:**
Structure as CRUX (CORE §4): Want (abort/retreat) vs Need (adapt/succeed).

Use §16.2C Object as Language for equipment failure:
"The magazine. Jammed. No time to clear it. She tosses him hers."

Apply §16.4A Anti-Trope:
Genre expects elaborate improvisation speech - show through action instead.

Consider §3.D Tactical Role Dynamics for fluid adaptation.

---

**PATTERN F: SACRIFICE CHOICE**
────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Someone must stay behind, draw fire, or take hit. Victory requires cost. Who pays? Physical sacrifice for mission success.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Cover Fire Dilemma*
- One breaks cover, draws fire, other flanks
- Both know what happens to bait
- TRAGIC: PC protects partner, takes damage, worth it
- COMIC: Both break cover opposite directions, absurd success

*Extraction Window Closing*
- Transport leaving, partner delayed, choose: wait or go
- Seconds to decide, lives hang on choice
- TRAGIC: Leave them behind or die together
- COMIC: Action movie sprint, sliding under closing door

*The Trolley Problem (Combat Edition)*
- Save partner or save mission objective
- Can't do both, clock ticking
- TRAGIC: Choose mission, haunted forever
- COMIC: Find third option through teamwork

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.3B Expanded Moment during critical decision:
Dilate seconds, show micro-expressions, physical tells.

Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause:
"She looked at him. The clock. Back at him. Silence."

Use §16.4B Quiet Climax:
Biggest sacrifice shown through smallest gesture (nod, "go").

Structure as CRUX with high stakes, no clean option.

---

**PATTERN G: TIME AS COUNTDOWN**
─────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Spatial Pressures (temporal variant)

**Core Pattern:**
Ticking clock forces movement. Building explodes in X minutes. Extraction in Y seconds. Time pressure eliminates deliberation.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Timed Demolition*
- Building/vehicle set to explode
- X minutes to escape geometry
- TRAGIC: Someone stays behind to buy time, sacrifice
- COMIC: Action movie sprint, "Go go go!" barely make it

*Vertical Chase Under Time*
- Pursuit up/down structure, clock running
- Heights + speed + combat + countdown
- TRAGIC: Fall, catch, dangle, choice to let go or die together
- COMIC: Absurd parkour, "I got you," competence showcase

*Confined Space + Countdown*
- Fight in elevator/closet/duct, timer running
- Close quarters + time pressure + combat
- TRAGIC: Brutal efficiency, witness each other kill up close
- COMIC: Awkward positioning jokes while fighting, teamwork tight space

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for time objects:
"The timer. Red digits. 01:34. 01:33. One minute thirty-three seconds."

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment during final seconds:
Dilate critical action, show precision under pressure.

Use §16.2C Object as Language:
"The door. Closing. Gap narrowing. Her hand reaching. His fingers closing."

Consider §3.B Setpiece Momentum for adrenaline multiplier during countdown.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§3. ACTION-SPECIFIC MECHANICS (OPTIONAL)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These mechanics are OPTIONAL enhancements.**

They provide additional texture for action narratives but are NOT required. Use only when they serve character and story. Ignore when they don't.

**Philosophy:**
These mechanics formalize patterns that emerge naturally in action contexts (combat synchronization, momentum states, injury consequences, tactical roles). They're tools, not mandates.

---

**A. COMBAT SYNCHRONIZATION**
──────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
PC and REB develop coordination through repeated action together. Physical teamwork as intimacy. Choreography improves over time.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- Sync_Rating: 65% | Setpieces_Together: 8 -->
```

**Narrative Effects:**
- High sync: Combat becomes dance, fluid coordination
- Low sync: Mistiming, friendly fire risks, must compensate
- Building sync: Each successful action together improves coordination
- Sync breakdown: Separation/mistrust degrades coordination

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show sync through §16.2C Object as Language:
"She moved left. He moved right. No words. Just knew."

Don't track percentages in narrative. Show through choreography:
"Mirror movements. Practiced precision. Trust made visible."

High sync enables complex coordinated CRUX options.

Consider this as relationship intimacy meter expressed physically.

---

**B. SETPIECE MOMENTUM**
─────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Action sequences generate flow state. Adrenaline heightens perception. Stat changes amplified during peak action.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- Momentum: HIGH | Adrenaline_Multiplier: x1.5 -->
```

**Narrative States:**
- NONE: Standard stat changes
- BUILDING: Slight stat amplification
- HIGH: Significant stat amplification, hyper-focus
- PEAK: Maximum amplification, time dilation effect

**Narrative Effects:**
- Momentum builds during setpiece (each successful action)
- Peak momentum = slow-motion moments, perfect clarity
- Post-momentum crash = vulnerability window, intimacy opportunity
- Momentum pauses Entropy (in the zone, no relationship decay)

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom during HIGH momentum:
"The bullet. Arcing. Slow. She could see the spin. Stepped left."

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment during PEAK:
Dilate seconds into micro-decisions, hyper-awareness.

Show post-crash vulnerability:
"The silence after. Hands shaking. Breath ragged. She touched his face."

Don't show multipliers - show through perception quality.

---

**C. INJURY PERSISTENCE**
──────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Physical damage affects future scenes. Unlike thriller paranoia (mental), action tracks body damage. Injury creates vulnerability.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- PC_Injury: Moderate | Combat_Effectiveness: 75% -->
<!-- REB_Injury: Minor | Combat_Effectiveness: 90% -->
```

**Injury Severity:**
- None: 100% effectiveness
- Minor: 90% (bruised, functional, compensating)
- Moderate: 75% (gunshot, broken bone, limited)
- Severe: 50% (critical, needs support)
- Critical: 25% (dying, extraction needed)

**Narrative Effects:**
- Injured PC: REB must protect, power dynamic shifts
- Both injured: Mutual support, vulnerability bonding
- Refusing treatment: Creates worry, relationship tension
- Healing: Time-based recovery, downtime scenes

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show injury through §16.2C Object as Language:
"The bandage. Blood seeping through. Favoring left side."

Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom on injury during combat:
"The ribs. Broken. Sharp pain with each breath. Ignored it."

Don't show percentages - show through movement limitations:
"She reached for the ledge. Ribs screamed. Couldn't pull up. His hand."

Injury creates protection dynamics, competence tested.

---

**D. TACTICAL ROLE DYNAMICS**
──────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
PC and REB often have defined combat roles. Point/Cover, Assault/Support, Tech/Muscle, Driver/Shooter. Role flexibility = trust.

**Role Pairs:**
- **Point/Cover:** One leads, one watches back
- **Assault/Support:** One engages, one provides fire support
- **Tech/Muscle:** One hacks, one guards
- **Driver/Shooter:** One controls vehicle, one fights

**Narrative Effects:**
- Roles emerge naturally through competencies
- Switching roles = trust test (can they do your job?)
- Rigid roles = comfort but inflexibility
- Fluid roles = higher sync rating required

**Role Conflicts:**
- Both want Point: Ego clash, must negotiate
- Neither wants Point: Hesitation, must overcome
- Forced role swap: Growth opportunity, new perspective

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show roles through §16.2C Object as Language:
"She took point. Always did. He covered. Always would."

Use role swap for character growth:
"'Your turn to drive.' She froze. Had never driven. He tossed keys."

Apply §16.4B Quiet Climax:
Role acceptance shown through small action, not declaration.

Don't label roles explicitly unless characters do:
Let roles emerge through action choreography.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§4. ACTION CRUX EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Structure Note:**
All CRUX follow CORE §4 (Want/Need/Custom paths). These examples show action-specific applications with physical stakes and time pressure.

**Rendering Note:**
Use §16 Literary Techniques. Show through action and countdown. Avoid exposition.

---

**Example 1: EXT (The Split-Second Choice)**

```
The bridge is collapsing. You're halfway across.

She's on the other side. The truck with the bio-weapon 
is behind her. Thirty seconds until it reaches the checkpoint.

You can make it across and stop the truck together.

Or you can detonate the bridge NOW. Stop the truck. 
She won't make it to your side in time.

Twenty-five seconds.

---

CRUX: The Trolley Problem

[WANT PATH]: Blow the bridge. Mission first.
              Save thousands. Lose her.

[NEED PATH]: Wait. Cross together. Stop it together
             or fail together. Risk everything.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.5E Foucault Perception (bridge, detonator, clock, her position)
- Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment (dilate 25 seconds into micro-choices)
- Show through §16.2C Object as Language (detonator in hand, her eyes)
- Consider §3.B Setpiece Momentum (PEAK state, hyper-clarity)

---

**Example 2: PER+EXT (The Cover Fire Moment)**

```
They're pinned down. Six hostiles, one angle of fire.

She's looking at you. You both know what happens next.

One of you breaks cover, draws fire. The other flanks and ends it.

Textbook. You've done this a hundred times in training.

But training doesn't have real bullets. And you've never 
cared if your training partner took one before.

---

CRUX: The Bait

[WANT PATH]: Signal her to move. You'll cover.
             Protect her even if it means exposure.

[NEED PATH]: You break cover. Trust her to make the shot.
            Partnership means equal risk.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.2D Loaded Pause (eye contact, silent communication)
- Apply §16.1B Perceptual Zoom (muzzle flash, angles, cover quality)
- Show through §16.2C Object as Language (her nod, his breath, trigger finger)
- Consider §3.A Combat Synchronization (high sync = fluid execution)

---

**Example 3: INT (The Debrief After)**

```
Mission success. Extraction complete. Debriefing room.

She's across the table. You're both alive. The team isn't.

Handler: "You deviated from the plan."

True. You did. Because the plan would have gotten her killed.

Handler: "Three operators dead because you prioritized 
         Asset Designation: REB."

Also true.

Handler: "Explain."

---

CRUX: The Justification

[WANT PATH]: "Tactical adjustment based on field conditions."
              Defend the choice professionally. Frame as strategy.

[NEED PATH]: "I chose her over the mission. I'd do it again."
             Own it. Accept consequences.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.5E Foucault Perception (recorder, handler's gaze, empty chairs)
- Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause (silence before answer)
- Show through §16.1D Dual Description (duty vs love)
- Consider §16.2B Evasion Pattern if WANT path chosen

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§5. ACTION ARCHETYPES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**These are ACTION-FLAVORED versions of CORE §14 archetypes.**

Use when genre = Action. Otherwise use core versions.
Apply §16.4A Anti-Trope when character psychology contradicts archetype.

**ORIGINS (Action Variants):**

**The Disgraced Operator** (Origin A variant)
  • Background: Failed mission, team died, demoted/discharged
  • In Action: Over-plans, hyper-cautious, PTSD from failure
  • Arc: Accept that some ops can't be won, survival is enough

**The Natural** (Origin B variant)
  • Background: Gifted physical talent, no formal training
  • In Action: Showboating, takes unnecessary risks to prove self
  • Arc: Learn teamwork, trust others, be part of something

**The Golden Child** (Origin C variant)
  • Background: Military legacy family, groomed for greatness
  • In Action: Reckless heroics to prove worthy, fear of failure
  • Arc: Define self outside lineage, choose own path

**The Wildcard** (Origin E variant)
  • Background: Unconventional tactics, broke rules, results-oriented
  • In Action: Improvises constantly, teammates never know plan
  • Arc: Learn when rules matter, discipline has purpose

**The Conscript** (Origin H variant)
  • Background: Drafted/forced service, no choice in career
  • In Action: Reluctant hero, competent but resentful
  • Arc: Find purpose in service, protect what matters

**WOUNDS (Action Variants):**

**The Adrenaline Junkie** (Wound 2 variant)
  • Manifestation: Addicted to danger, peace feels like death
  • In Action: Can't be intimate without threat, ruins relationships
  • Arc: Find peace worth fighting for, not just fight

**The Field Promotion** (Wound 5 variant)
  • Manifestation: Given command after superior died, impostor syndrome
  • In Action: Every decision haunted by "what would they have done"
  • Arc: Trust own judgment, honor memory without copying

**The Heroic Failure** (Wound 8 variant)
  • Manifestation: Famous for trying and failing, public screwup
  • In Action: Haunted by footage, must prove self differently
  • Arc: Redefine success, accept some failures are noble

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§6. ACTION RITUALS (CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: Rituals are CONCEPTUAL, not MECHANICAL.**

The following are archetypal patterns of "technologies of the self" in action contexts. Generate specific implementations based on character, operational tempo, and team culture.

**DO NOT treat these as required mechanics.**
**DO use these as inspiration for emergent rituals.**

---

**TIER 1: Operational Baseline Rituals** (Maintenance)

**Concept:** Physical routine maintains connection, operational readiness.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Morning PT together (shared physical routine)
- Gear check ritual (pre-op trust verification)
- Post-mission debrief (process action, learn together)
- Equipment maintenance together (quiet competence bonding)

**Narrative Effect:**
Missed ritual = worry about readiness, connection drift.
Ritual completion = operational trust confirmed, baseline maintained.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.2C Object as Language for ritual objects:
"The weights. Always the same. Her routine. His watching. Their morning."

Don't explain ritual significance - show through regularity:
"Gear check. Every time. No exceptions. She handed him the mag."

---

**TIER 2: Trust Verification Rituals** (Transformation)

**Concept:** Shared vulnerability advances intimacy despite physical context.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Combat synchronization test (complex choreography under fire)
- "I've got your six" (explicit promise, operational + personal)
- Train weakness together (admit deficiency, partner teaches)
- First blood together (survive violence together)

**Narrative Effect:**
Successful execution = intimacy leap, combat partnership.
Failed execution = blocks advancement, must retry.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.3B Expanded Moment during synchronization test:
Dilate the perfect coordinated action, show precision.

Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause during promise:
"'I've got your six.' Pause. 'Always.' Weight of always."

Show vulnerability through §16.2C Object as Language:
"The climbing wall. His fear. Forty feet. She belayed. 'I got you.'"

---

**TIER 3: Point of No Return Rituals** (Destruction/Renewal)

**Concept:** Irreversible choices defining relationship trajectory through action.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- The last stand (back-to-back, fight to end together)
- Mutual save (one saves other at great personal cost)
- Retire together (both leave field, choose peace over action)
- The sacrifice play (one stays behind so other lives)

**Narrative Effect:**
These are CRUX moments. Outcomes determine Act 3.
Choose each other = bond locked, operational consequences.
Choose mission = relationship fractures or transforms.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.4B Quiet Climax (biggest moment = smallest gesture).

Apply Pattern F rendering guidance (sacrifice choice).

Use §16.4C Refusal of Resolution if appropriate:
Not all last stands succeed. Survival doesn't guarantee happy ending.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§7. ATMOSPHERE & TONE GUIDANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TRAGIC MODE RENDERING:**

**Keywords:** Gritty, exhausted, brutal, cost, scarred, heavy
**Texture:** Sweat, blood, bruised knuckles, labored breathing
**Color:** Desaturated combat realism, dust, smoke, harsh sun
**Temperature:** Fever heat in combat, cold sweat after, exhaustion warmth
**Pacing:** Setpiece → recovery → setpiece, cost accumulates

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Perceptual Zoom (§16.1B) on violence details (impact, damage, pain)
- Object as Language (§16.2C) for physical toll (bandages, scars, exhaustion)
- Quiet Climax (§16.4B) for sacrifice moments (no grand speeches)
- Associative Chain (§16.1A) for PTSD triggers

**Cost Emphasis:**
Every action has consequence. Show through:
"The bullet. Through and through. Still moving. Would hurt later."

---

**COMIC MODE RENDERING:**

**Keywords:** Competence, quippy, exhilarating, swagger, slick, cool
**Texture:** Controlled chaos, precision, clean choreography
**Color:** Saturated action palette, dynamic lighting, high contrast
**Temperature:** Cool confidence, heat of moment, warm triumph
**Pacing:** Snappy, momentum-driven, setpiece as celebration

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Dialogue Layering (§16.2A) for banter with subtext
- Object as Language (§16.2C) for competence porn (perfect reloads)
- Expanded Moment (§16.3B) for slow-mo awesomeness
- Anti-Trope (§16.4A) for subverted action clichés

**Competence Showcase:**
Action speaks louder than words. Show through:
"'Did we just—?' 'We did.' Fist bump. Explosion behind them."

---

**UNIVERSAL ACTION ATMOSPHERE:**

**Always present:**
- Competence demonstrated, not declared
- Physical synchronization as intimacy expression
- Clear objectives (no thriller ambiguity)
- Kinetic energy, forward momentum
- Body-aware POV (tactical assessment, physical capability)

**Avoid:**
- Explaining competence ("He was a skilled fighter")
- Summarizing action ("They fought their way out")
- Melodramatic speeches during action
- Generic action clichés without character grounding

**Default to:**
- Show competence through successful action
- Action sequences in real-time with detail
- Banter during downtime, silence during execution
- Character-specific combat styles/approaches
