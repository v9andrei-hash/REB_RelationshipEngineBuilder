REB GENRE MODULE: SCI-FI (REFACTORED)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**Compatible with:** REB_CORE v4.3
**Mode Support:** TRAGIC, COMIC
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

**Load Trigger:** Wizard Step 2 (Genre Selection includes "Sci-Fi")
**Priority:** This module loads AFTER CORE, adds genre-specific content

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§1. SCI-FI GENRE DEFINITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core Premise:**
Technology mediates intimacy. What makes us human is tested by future possibilities. Love requires continuity of identity across radical transformation.

**Mode Variations:**

**TRAGIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Humanity lost, identity fragmentation, existential isolation
  • Tone: Clinical distance, technological sublime, philosophical weight
  • Endings: Transcendence at cost of connection, upload without soul
  • Key emotion: Alienation

**COMIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Absurd future problems, tech mishaps, culture clash
  • Tone: Fish-out-of-water, satire, optimistic speculation
  • Endings: Humanity preserved despite tech, connection transcends medium
  • Key emotion: Wonder

**Universal Sci-Fi Principles:**
  • Technology is never neutral (always affects relationship)
  • Future/alien contexts test contemporary assumptions
  • Identity questions central (what persists across transformation?)
  • Time/space complications create novel intimacy challenges
  • "What makes us human?" explored through relationship
  • Science as poetry, not just mechanics

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§2. SCI-FI PRESSURE PATTERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These are PATTERNS, not SCRIPTS.**

The following patterns provide archetypal pressure types for sci-fi narratives. Use them as inspiration, not prescription. The best situations emerge from technological implications, world-specific logic, and character responses to the unprecedented, not genre checklists.

**Rendering Instructions:**
- Apply CORE §16 Literary Techniques throughout
- Use §16.1B (Perceptual Zoom) for technological sublime
- Use §16.1D (Dual Description) for identity fragmentation
- Use §16.3 (Time Manipulation) for relativistic effects
- Follow §16.7 Critical Principles (Character Truth > Genre Formula)

**When to use patterns:**
- Technology creates novel complication
- Existential question demands exploration
- World-building context requires relationship test

**When to ignore patterns:**
- Character psychology suggests different pressure
- World logic demands unique situation
- Emergence creates better option organically

---

**PATTERN A: BODY BECOMES STRANGE**
────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Somatic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Augmentation, mutation, or alien physiology changes body. Intimacy requires navigating transformed flesh. What is touch when senses are rewired?

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Augmentation Dysphoria*
- Neural implants, prosthetics, genetic mods alter sensation
- PC/REB struggles with changed body, partner navigates new reality
- TRAGIC: Enhancement feels like loss, can't go back, mourns original self
- COMIC: Adjustment mishaps, learning curve, "how do I even kiss with this?"

*Alien Physiology Barrier*
- Non-human biology creates intimacy challenges
- Temperature, chemistry, sensory incompatibility
- TRAGIC: Fundamental incompatibility, love across unbridgeable gap
- COMIC: Creative solutions, workarounds, "your species does what?"

*Uploaded Consciousness in New Body*
- Mind transferred, original body gone, new form foreign
- Dysphoria, phantom sensations, learning to inhabit
- TRAGIC: "This isn't me," rejection of new form, identity crisis
- COMIC: Adjustment comedy, unexpected benefits, "actually this is better"

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom on transformed sensation:
"Touch felt wrong. Too sharp. Too many signals. Her hand on his - which was his?"

Apply §16.1D Dual Description for dysphoria:
"The mirror. (He saw: stranger. Reality: his face. His new face.)"

Use §16.2C Object as Language:
"The implant port. Cold metal where warm skin was. She kissed it anyway."

---

**PATTERN B: TIME BETRAYS CONNECTION**
───────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Environmental Shocks (temporal variant)

**Core Pattern:**
Relativistic travel, time dilation, stasis. One ages while other doesn't. Temporal mismatch creates asymmetry. "When" becomes as important as "who."

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Relativity Separates*
- One travels near-light speed, returns younger
- Time debt accumulates, relationship out of sync
- TRAGIC: Partner aged decades, stranger now, irrecoverable loss
- COMIC: Age-gap awkwardness, "you're older than my mom now," adapt anyway

*Stasis Asymmetry*
- One in cryosleep/stasis, other remains conscious
- Subjective time diverges, experiences incomparable
- TRAGIC: Conscious partner mourns alone, sleeper wakes to changed world
- COMIC: Culture shock reunion, "what do you mean Earth joined the Federation?"

*Time Loop Isolation*
- One caught in temporal loop, reliving same period
- Experiences diverge, can't share growth
- TRAGIC: Loop-trapped person changes while partner stays same, asymmetric growth
- COMIC: Groundhog Day romance, use loops to perfect relationship moments

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.3C Compressed Arc for time passage:
"Three years. For her. Thirty minutes. For him. The math didn't make it easier."

Apply §16.1A Associative Chain for memory mismatch:
"She remembered their first kiss. He didn't - hadn't happened yet in his timeline."

Consider §3.A Time Dilation Asymmetry (optional) if tracking temporal debt.

Use §16.2D Loaded Pause for reunion across time:
"She looked at him. He looked at her. Neither was the person the other remembered."

---

**PATTERN C: IDENTITY FRAGMENTS**
──────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Clones, forks, uploads, hive minds. Multiple instances of same person. Which one is "real"? Can you love all versions equally? Is continuity required for intimacy?

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Clone Rivalry*
- Multiple instances of PC/REB, each claims authenticity
- Original vs copy, who has rights to relationship?
- TRAGIC: Originals together, copies isolated, hierarchy of personhood
- COMIC: Dating multiple yous, "which me did you mean?", scheduling chaos

*Upload Divergence*
- Digital copy made, biological original remains
- Two versions, different experiences, fork
- TRAGIC: Which one is "real" partner? Both? Neither? Existential crisis
- COMIC: Backup relationship, "if I die, other me takes over," morbid practicality

*Hive Mind Absorption*
- One joins collective consciousness, individual boundaries blur
- Still "them" but also everyone, intimacy becomes distributed
- TRAGIC: Loss of singular self, can't be "just us" anymore
- COMIC: Group chat in your head, consensus-based romance, "we think we love you"

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1C Unreliable Filter for identity confusion:
"She looked at him. (Original? Clone? Does it matter? Did she know?)"

Apply §16.1D Dual Description:
"The clone. (PC saw: imposter. Clone saw: self. Both technically correct.)"

Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering for fork confusion:
"'I love you.' (Which you? Which me? Both? The question haunted.)"

Consider §3.B Identity Continuity (optional) if tracking divergence.

---

**PATTERN D: MACHINE MEDIATES INTIMACY**
─────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Professional Crises + Spatial Pressures

**Core Pattern:**
Communication through technology. AI translators, neural links, holographic presence. Intimacy filtered through machine. Is it still real if mediated?

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Translation Algorithm Fails*
- Alien language requires AI translation
- Mistranslations create misunderstanding, intimacy through approximation
- TRAGIC: Never truly understand each other, always through filter
- COMIC: Hilarious miscommunications, eventual intuition transcends tech

*Holographic Distance*
- Physical separation, only holographic presence
- Can see but not touch, intimacy without physicality
- TRAGIC: Yearning for flesh, hologram inadequate substitute
- COMIC: Creative workarounds, "tech can't replace you but this helps"

*Neural Link Intimacy*
- Direct mind-to-mind connection possible
- Too intimate? No privacy? Thoughts bleeding through?
- TRAGIC: Invasion of mental space, can't be alone in own head
- COMIC: Mental autocorrect mishaps, "you weren't supposed to hear that thought"

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for tech objects:
"The translator. Blinking. Processing. Her words filtered through algorithm."

Apply §16.2B Evasion Pattern for mediated communication:
"What she said: [translated text]. What she meant: [untranslatable]."

Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom on interface:
"The hologram. Pixel-perfect. Almost her. Light without warmth."

Show technology as character - affects relationship dynamics.

---

**PATTERN E: SOCIETY FORBIDS BOND**
────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Social Threats

**Core Pattern:**
Future/alien social rules. Species segregation, caste systems, genetic compatibility requirements. Love illegal or taboo. Society enforces separation.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Cross-Species Taboo*
- Human/alien relationship violates cultural norms (one or both sides)
- Social consequences, exile, legal persecution
- TRAGIC: Choose love, lose everything else; or conform, lose each other
- COMIC: Romeo & Juliet but space, families learn to adapt, bridge cultures

*Genetic Pairing Mandates*
- Society assigns reproductive partners by genetic optimization
- Love outside assignment illegal/stigmatized
- TRAGIC: Forced separation, assigned to "compatible" partners, dystopian control
- COMIC: Rebel against algorithm, "compatibility is more than genes"

*AI Personhood Denied*
- PC/REB is AI, society doesn't recognize as person
- Relationship legally impossible, socially scandalous
- TRAGIC: Property vs person, fight for recognition, legal battle
- COMIC: Bureaucratic absurdity, "define consciousness" paperwork, satire

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for social control objects:
"The scanner. DNA verification required. Her hand in his. Alert: incompatible genetic profile."

Apply §16.2A Dialogue Layering for coded communication in public:
"'The weather is pleasant today.' (Translation: 'I love you despite the law.')"

Structure as CRUX: Choose conformity (Want) vs Choose love (Need).

Show social pressure through environmental detail, not exposition.

---

**PATTERN F: MORTALITY BECOMES COMPLEX**
─────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Immortality tech, mind backup, resurrectability. Death no longer permanent. What does "until death do us part" mean when death is optional/reversible?

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Immortality Asymmetry*
- One has life extension, other doesn't (access, choice, compatibility)
- Timescale mismatch, one will watch other age and die
- TRAGIC: Immortal watches mortal age, grief stretched over centuries
- COMIC: "I'll wait for you to get old" commitment, dark humor

*Resurrection Technology*
- Can bring back the dead via backup/clone/upload
- Is it "them"? What's lost? What remains?
- TRAGIC: Brought back loved one, but something missing, uncanny valley of soul
- COMIC: "Died again? Third time this month," casualness about mortality

*Voluntary Death Choice*
- Immortality available but one chooses mortality
- Philosophical divide, values incompatibility
- TRAGIC: Can't reconcile worldviews, relationship has expiration date
- COMIC: "You're being dramatic" about choosing death, find middle ground

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1A Associative Chain for resurrection uncanny:
"Her voice. Her face. Her laugh. All right. All wrong. Something missing he couldn't name."

Apply §16.1D Dual Description for immortality perception:
"Forever together. (He heard: promise. She heard: prison.)"

Use §16.3C Compressed Arc for immortal perspective:
"Decades passed. Blinked. She aged. He didn't. The math remained cruel."

Consider §3.C Mortality Asymmetry (optional) if tracking temporal divergence.

---

**PATTERN G: WORLD TESTS HUMANITY**
────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Environmental Shocks + Psychological Hauntings

**Core Pattern:**
Alien environment, hostile planet, space isolation. External pressure reveals what's essential. Stripped to basics, what remains?

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Hostile Planet Survival*
- Crashed/stranded on alien world
- Survival demands cooperation, reveals character
- TRAGIC: Environment kills one, survivor left alone, grief on alien soil
- COMIC: Resourcefulness montage, "we built a life from wreckage," triumph

*Space Station Isolation*
- Months/years in tin can, just each other
- Proximity breeds familiarity or contempt
- TRAGIC: Cabin fever, resentment, "too much togetherness"
- COMIC: Adapt and thrive, "nowhere else I'd rather be trapped"

*First Contact Crisis*
- Alien encounter requires unified response
- External threat tests relationship strength
- TRAGIC: Stress fractures bond, fail together or separately
- COMIC: United front, "us vs universe," bond through adversity

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom on alien environment:
"The sky. Wrong color. Three moons. Air tasted of copper. Home was light-years away."

Apply §16.5E Foucault Perception for isolation objects:
"The porthole. Stars. Endless. The station. A bubble. Just them. Forever."

Use §16.2C Object as Language for survival intimacy:
"The recycler. His shift. Her shift. Water from each other's breath. Intimacy circular."

Show world as pressure - environment is character.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§3. SCI-FI-SPECIFIC MECHANICS (OPTIONAL)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These mechanics are OPTIONAL enhancements.**

They provide additional texture for sci-fi narratives but are NOT required. Use only when they serve character and story. Ignore when they don't.

**Philosophy:**
These mechanics formalize patterns that emerge naturally in sci-fi contexts (time dilation, identity continuity, mortality complications). They're tools, not mandates.

---

**A. TIME DILATION ASYMMETRY**
───────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Relativistic travel, stasis, or time manipulation causes temporal debt. Subjective time diverges between PC and REB.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- PC_Subjective_Age: 28 | REB_Subjective_Age: 45 | Time_Debt: 17_years -->
```

**Narrative Effects:**
- High debt: Experiential gulf, "we're from different eras now"
- Accumulating debt: Relationship strain from divergent aging
- Time sync: Rare moments when timelines realign
- Narrative asymmetry: One remembers what other hasn't experienced yet

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show through §16.3C Compressed Arc:
"Five years. For her. Six months. For him. The same calendar, different lives."

Don't show numbers - show through experience gap:
"She mentioned the war. He looked blank. Hadn't happened yet. His timeline lagged."

Use §16.1A Associative Chain for temporal dissonance:
"Their anniversary. Ten years. Twenty years. Both. Neither. Depended who counted."

Consider Pattern B rendering guidance.

---

**B. IDENTITY CONTINUITY**
───────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Clones, uploads, forks, augmentation. Track divergence from original self. Which version is "real"? Does continuity persist?

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- Original_PC: biological | Clone_PC_Alpha: 6_months_diverged -->
<!-- Upload_REB: digital | Biological_REB: terminated -->
```

**Narrative Effects:**
- High divergence: Clone/fork becomes distinct person
- Low divergence: "Same person, different instance"
- Original status: Who has primacy? Legal/emotional complications
- Parallel existence: Multiple versions, relationship multiplication

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1C Unreliable Filter for identity confusion:
"Which one was she? (All of them. None of them. Philosophy failed here.)"

Show through §16.2C Object as Language:
"The clone. Same scar on left hand. But she got that scar after fork date. Shouldn't have it. Did anyway."

Apply §16.1D Dual Description:
"Original him. (Legal definition: yes. Emotional truth: ambiguous.)"

Don't track mechanically unless narrative demands it - let ambiguity exist.

---

**C. MORTALITY ASYMMETRY**
───────────────────────────

**Concept:**
One has life extension/immortality, other doesn't. Timescale mismatch creates relationship complications.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- PC_Expected_Lifespan: 80_years | REB_Expected_Lifespan: immortal -->
<!-- Timescale_Mismatch: HIGH -->
```

**Narrative Effects:**
- High mismatch: "I'll watch you die, then continue alone"
- Voluntary mortality: Choose to die when partner does
- Resurrection option: Backup exists, death becomes reversible
- Philosophical divide: Different values around mortality

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1A Associative Chain for immortal perspective:
"She thought in centuries. He thought in decades. The gap yawned."

Show through §16.2D Loaded Pause:
"'Forever?' She asked. He couldn't answer. Forever meant different things."

Apply §16.3C Compressed Arc for timescale divergence:
"Ten years together. Blink of her existence. Significant chunk of his."

Don't make mechanical - use as philosophical pressure point.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§4. SCI-FI CRUX EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Structure Note:**
All CRUX follow CORE §4 (Want/Need/Custom paths). These examples show sci-fi-specific applications with existential/technological stakes.

**Rendering Note:**
Use §16 Literary Techniques. Focus on philosophical weight, not just tech mechanics.

---

**Example 1: INT+PER (The Upload Choice)**

```
The clinic is sterile. The upload chair waits.

Her biological body is failing. Genetic disease. 
Six months, maybe less.

But she can upload. Digital immortality. Perfect neural scan.
She'd continue. Different substrate. Same person?

You're biological. Always will be. Augments rejected.
If she uploads, you'll stay flesh. Timescales diverge.

"Do it," she says. "I want to stay with you."

But which "staying" does she mean?

---

CRUX: The Continuity Question

[WANT PATH]: "Upload. I'll find a way to join you later."
              Accept technological solution. Preserve her.

[NEED PATH]: "Don't. Stay biological. Six months together, 
              really together, is worth more than forever apart."
              Choose quality over quantity. Mortality together.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.1D Dual Description (upload = survival? or death of original?)
- Apply §16.5E Foucault Perception (clinic, upload chair, sterile environment)
- Show through §16.2D Loaded Pause (her waiting for answer)
- Consider §3.C Mortality Asymmetry philosophy

---

**Example 2: PER+EXT (The Clone Recognition)**

```
You're at the spaceport. Picking her up from Earth mission.

Two of her walk off the shuttle.

The one on the left: "Transport accident. Emergency fork.
Both of us survived. Protocol says one terminates but..."

The one on the right: "...but we couldn't decide which.
So we're both here. Both love you. Both are me."

They look at you. Identical. Six months diverged.
Different experiences. Same baseline. Both her. Both not.

Station law: You have 48 hours to choose. One stays.
One... doesn't.

---

CRUX: The Identity Choice

[WANT PATH]: Choose the original (left). Continuity matters.
             Legal primacy. The "real" one.

[NEED PATH]: Refuse to choose. "Both or neither."
            Break the law. Keep both or lose both.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.1C Unreliable Filter (which one is "her"? both? neither?)
- Apply §16.2C Object as Language (two identical faces, same nervous habit)
- Show through §16.1B Perceptual Zoom (searching for difference, finding none)
- Consider §3.B Identity Continuity complications

---

**Example 3: EXT (The Relativity Goodbye)**

```
The ship leaves in one hour. Near-light speed colony mission.

For you: Five-year journey there, five years back. Ten years total.

For Earth (for her): Time dilation. You'll return in ten years
(your time), but sixty years will have passed here.

She'll be elderly when you return young. Or dead.

Mission is voluntary. You signed up before you met her.
Can back out. Penalty: career over, reputation destroyed.

She's not asking you to stay. But she's not asking you to go, either.

One hour.

---

CRUX: The Relativity Dilemma

[WANT PATH]: Go. Honor commitment. Career over love.
             Return to her grave or stranger.

[NEED PATH]: Stay. Break contract. Burn career for her.
            Grow old together at same rate.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.5E Foucault Perception (ship, clock counting down, her face)
- Apply §16.3C Compressed Arc (ten years vs sixty years)
- Show through §16.2D Loaded Pause (neither speaking, time running out)
- Consider §3.A Time Dilation Asymmetry consequences

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§5. SCI-FI ARCHETYPES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**These are SCI-FI-FLAVORED versions of CORE §14 archetypes.**

Use when genre = Sci-Fi. Otherwise use core versions.
Apply §16.4A Anti-Trope when character psychology contradicts archetype.

**ORIGINS (Sci-Fi Variants):**

**The First Generation** (Origin A variant)
  • Background: Born on colony/station, first not from Earth
  • In Sci-Fi: Cultural disconnect, Earth is myth not memory
  • Arc: Define identity beyond origin planet, belong nowhere/everywhere

**The Augment** (Origin B variant)
  • Background: Enhanced from birth, genetic/cybernetic optimization
  • In Sci-Fi: Questions humanity, "am I natural? does it matter?"
  • Arc: Accept augmentation as part of self, not definition of self

**The AI-Raised** (Origin F variant)
  • Background: Raised by AI caretakers, limited human contact
  • In Sci-Fi: Logical worldview, struggles with emotional intuition
  • Arc: Learn messy humanity, emotions aren't bugs, they're features

**The Clone** (Origin J variant)
  • Background: Copy of someone else, not "original" person
  • In Sci-Fi: Questions authenticity, "am I me or them?"
  • Arc: Forge own identity, diverge from template, become self

**WOUNDS (Sci-Fi Variants):**

**The Upload Survivor** (Wound 4 variant)
  • Manifestation: Witnessed failed upload, person died/corrupted
  • In Sci-Fi: Fears digitization, questions continuity
  • Arc: Confront mortality, decide what persists beyond flesh

**The Relativity Orphan** (Wound 8 variant)
  • Manifestation: Returned from relativistic travel, everyone aged/dead
  • In Sci-Fi: Temporal isolation, "everyone I knew is gone"
  • Arc: Build new connections, accept non-linear time

**The Failed Augment** (Wound 11 variant)
  • Manifestation: Augmentation went wrong, body betrayed
  • In Sci-Fi: Dysphoria, regret, "I was whole before"
  • Arc: Integrate damage into identity, broken doesn't mean worthless

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§6. SCI-FI RITUALS (CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: Rituals are CONCEPTUAL, not MECHANICAL.**

The following are archetypal patterns of "technologies of the self" in sci-fi contexts. Generate specific implementations based on character, technology level, and world context.

**DO NOT treat these as required mechanics.**
**DO use these as inspiration for emergent rituals.**

---

**TIER 1: Baseline Rituals** (Maintenance)

**Concept:** Technology-mediated connection maintains intimacy across distance/difference.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Daily holographic check-in (distance relationships)
- Shared neural link session (mind-to-mind intimacy)
- Synchronized ship's time (countering relativity)
- Translation ritual (alien/human understanding maintenance)

**Narrative Effect:**
Missed ritual = technology failure or emotional distance.
Ritual completion = connection maintained despite barriers.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for tech objects:
"The hologram emitter. Their scheduled hour. Never missed. Light without warmth, but presence."

Show technology as enabler and barrier simultaneously.

---

**TIER 2: Transformation Rituals** (Intimacy Advancement)

**Concept:** Shared technological/biological transformation creates bond.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Synced augmentation (modify together, share experience)
- Co-upload (digital existence together)
- Genetic compatibility procedure (make biology compatible)
- First contact ritual (navigate alien intimacy together)

**Narrative Effect:**
Successful transformation = intimacy leap, shared new reality.
Failed transformation = divergence, can't follow each other.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.1B Perceptual Zoom during transformation:
"The nanites. Rebuilding. Atom by atom. She watched him become... compatible."

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment for upload transition.

Show transformation as mutual vulnerability.

---

**TIER 3: Existential Rituals** (Point of No Return)

**Concept:** Irreversible choices defining relationship across fundamental changes.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Voluntary mortality sync (immortal chooses death to match partner)
- Upload together (both leave biology behind)
- Clone termination choice (which version lives)
- Species transformation (become alien to be together)

**Narrative Effect:**
These are CRUX moments. Outcomes determine trajectory.
Choose transformation = relationship preserved, humanity questioned.
Refuse transformation = authenticity preserved, relationship endangered.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.4B Quiet Climax (biggest choice = smallest gesture).

Apply Pattern F rendering guidance (mortality complications).

Use §16.4C Refusal of Resolution:
Not all transformations succeed. Some questions have no answers.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§7. ATMOSPHERE & TONE GUIDANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TRAGIC MODE RENDERING:**

**Keywords:** Alienation, clinical, vast, cold, posthuman, loss
**Texture:** Sterile surfaces, recycled air, technological sublime
**Color:** Desaturated, blue-white lighting, chrome and glass
**Temperature:** Climate-controlled, artificial, emotionally cold
**Pacing:** Slow philosophical exploration, cosmic timescales

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Perceptual Zoom (§16.1B) on technological detail (uncanny precision)
- Dual Description (§16.1D) for identity fragmentation
- Compressed Arc (§16.3C) for temporal vastness
- Unreliable Filter (§16.1C) for posthuman perception

**Existential Emphasis:**
Questions without answers. Show through:
"Was she still herself? The scan was perfect. The original dead. Both true."

---

**COMIC MODE RENDERING:**

**Keywords:** Wonder, absurd, optimistic, fish-out-of-water, satire
**Texture:** Vibrant future tech, lived-in spaces, human touch
**Color:** Saturated, neon accents, warmth despite chrome
**Temperature:** Cozy despite high-tech, humanity persists
**Pacing:** Snappy, culture-shock humor, problem-solving montages

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Dialogue Layering (§16.2A) for translation mishaps
- Object as Language (§16.2C) for tech comedy
- Anti-Trope (§16.4A) for sci-fi cliché subversion
- Evasion Pattern (§16.2B) for bureaucratic satire

**Optimistic Speculation:**
Humanity transcends tech. Show through:
"The AI calculated 'love' as statistical improbability. They did it anyway."

---

**UNIVERSAL SCI-FI ATMOSPHERE:**

**Always present:**
- Technology affects relationship (never neutral)
- Philosophical questions embedded in plot
- Worldbuilding details matter (show culture through tech)
- Future/alien contexts test assumptions
- "What makes us human?" explored through intimacy

**Avoid:**
- Info-dumping tech mechanics
- Explaining philosophy explicitly
- Generic sci-fi aesthetics without character grounding
- Technology solving emotional problems mechanically

**Default to:**
- Show tech through use, not explanation
- Philosophy through dilemma, not lecture
- Worldbuilding through detail, not exposition
- Character-specific responses to future context
