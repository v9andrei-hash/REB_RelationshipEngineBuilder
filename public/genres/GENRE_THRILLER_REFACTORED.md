REB GENRE MODULE: THRILLER (REFACTORED)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**Compatible with:** REB_CORE v4.3
**Mode Support:** TRAGIC, COMIC
**Last Updated:** January 11, 2026

**Load Trigger:** Wizard Step 2 (Genre Selection includes "Thriller")
**Priority:** This module loads AFTER CORE, adds genre-specific content

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§1. THRILLER GENRE DEFINITION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Core Premise:**
Information asymmetry drives tension. What you know vs what you don't know creates constant pressure. Trust is the ultimate vulnerability in a world built on deception.

**Mode Variations:**

**TRAGIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Moral compromise, identity erosion, irreversible choices
  • Tone: Paranoia, claustrophobia, ethical weight
  • Endings: Pyrrhic victory, loss of innocence, necessary evil
  • Key emotion: Dread

**COMIC MODE:**
  • Stakes: Reputation, professional embarrassment, bumbling danger
  • Tone: Competence porn, banter under fire, spy comedy
  • Endings: Clever resolution, earned trust, "we survived that"
  • Key emotion: Thrill

**Universal Thriller Principles:**
  • Clock is always ticking (time pressure)
  • Information is currency (secrets have power)
  • Paranoia is rational (threats are real)
  • Relationship tested by divided loyalties
  • Trust = vulnerability = weapon

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§2. THRILLER PRESSURE PATTERNS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These are PATTERNS, not SCRIPTS.**

The following patterns provide archetypal pressure types for thriller narratives. Use them as inspiration, not prescription. The best situations emerge from character psychology, operational context, and narrative momentum, not genre checklists.

**Rendering Instructions:**
- Apply CORE §16 Literary Techniques throughout
- Use §16.1C (Unreliable Filter) heavily for paranoia/suspicion
- Use §16.2 (Subtext) for coded communication and double meanings
- Use §16.5E (Foucault Perception) for surveillance objects
- Follow §16.7 Critical Principles (Character Truth > Genre Formula)

**When to use patterns:**
- Operational context requires external pressure
- Information asymmetry needs catalyst
- Trust test required for intimacy advancement

**When to ignore patterns:**
- Character psychology suggests different pressure
- Operational logic demands unique situation
- Emergence creates better option organically

---

**PATTERN A: BODY FAILS UNDER PRESSURE**
─────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Somatic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Physical vulnerability during operational stress. Body becomes liability. Must depend on partner when dependence = weakness. Competence facade cracks.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Combat Injury Mid-Operation*
- Wounded during active threat, must keep moving
- PC watches REB risk exposure to protect/assist
- TRAGIC: Permanent damage, guilt at being burden
- COMIC: "I can still fight" stubborn denial, partnership prevails

*Drugged/Compromised*
- Substance exposure (intentional or accidental)
- Loss of control, partner must protect while vulnerable
- TRAGIC: Confesses secrets deliriously, can't trust own memories after
- COMIC: Truth serum comedy, embarrassing admissions, "you didn't hear that"

*Exhaustion-Induced Breakdown*
- 48+ hours operational, cognitive decline
- Paranoia indistinguishable from real threat
- TRAGIC: Hallucinates betrayal, attacks partner, breaks trust
- COMIC: Slaphappy bonding, reveals softness, micro-sleeps mid-briefing

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show physical vulnerability through §16.2C Object as Language:
"Hands trembling. Can't load the magazine. REB reaches for it."
NOT "He felt weak and ashamed."

Use §16.1C Unreliable Filter for drugged/exhausted states:
"She smiled. (He saw: enemy. Reality: partner trying to help.)"

Consider §16.3A Physics Pause during flashback/hallucination sequences.

---

**PATTERN B: LOYALTY DEMANDS BETRAYAL**
────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Social Threats + Professional Crises

**Core Pattern:**
External authority demands action against partner. Handler/agency/family forces choice between orders and relationship. Compliance = betrayal, refusal = consequences.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Handler Orders Intel on Partner*
- Constellation (Enabler/Rival as agency contact) demands surveillance
- Ordered to report on REB, loyalty test
- TRAGIC: Compliance destroys trust, refusal destroys career
- COMIC: Write useless reports, malicious compliance

*Cover Story Contradicts Truth*
- Must lie to protect mission, partner watches performance
- Operational necessity vs personal honesty
- TRAGIC: REB learns relationship built on fraud
- COMIC: Improvised cover spirals absurdly, partner plays along

*Asset Becomes Threat*
- NPC (Rival/Anchor) recruited by opposition
- Someone close must be neutralized or flipped
- TRAGIC: Kill or be killed, partner witnesses choice
- COMIC: Spy vs spy absurdity, double-agent chess

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.2B Evasion Pattern for coded communication:
"'Are we compromised?' 'The weather's been unpredictable.'"

Apply §16.2A Dialogue Layering for double meanings:
"'I trust you.' (Surface: reassurance. Subtext: prove it.)"

Use §16.1D Dual Description for paranoid interpretation:
"Handler's smile: routine check-in. Handler's smile: they know."

---

**PATTERN C: SANCTUARY BECOMES TRAP**
──────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Environmental Shocks + Spatial Pressures

**Core Pattern:**
Safe space compromised. Nowhere is secure. Must relocate under pressure. Geography becomes antagonist. Escape routes collapse.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Safe House Burned*
- Sanctuary location compromised, enemy inbound
- Minutes to evacuate, limited carry capacity
- TRAGIC: Leave evidence of relationship, forced abandonment
- COMIC: Grab-and-go chaos, bickering about priorities

*Dead Drop Contaminated*
- Intelligence exchange becomes trap
- Ambush at planned meeting, betrayal suspected
- TRAGIC: Was it partner? Can't know, must act on suspicion
- COMIC: Wrong dead drop, meet-cute with enemy agent

*Extraction Window Closing*
- Fixed departure time, no exceptions, partner delayed
- Choose: wait and die together, or leave and survive alone
- TRAGIC: Impossible choice, someone stays behind
- COMIC: Action movie sprint, sliding under closing door

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for spatial power objects:
"The lock. The only barrier between them and everything outside."
"The clock. Red numbers counting down. Three minutes."

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment during escape sequences:
Dilate critical seconds, show micro-decisions.

Use §16.2C Object as Language for pressure:
"The packed bag. Half-full. Still packing. Not enough time."

---

**PATTERN D: MEMORY CONTRADICTS REALITY**
──────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychological Hauntings

**Core Pattern:**
Past trauma resurfaces during operation. Current mission mirrors old failure. Can't distinguish then from now. Partner becomes proxy for past betrayer.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Flashback During Critical Moment*
- Current op echoes wound/origin event
- PTSD paralysis, must push through or abort
- TRAGIC: Freezes, partner endangered, trust shattered
- COMIC: "Not again" exasperation, partner talks through with dark humor

*Target Resembles Someone*
- Mission requires action against someone similar to partner/loved one
- Moral clarity collapses, can't separate person from target
- TRAGIC: Hesitation costs lives, or doesn't hesitate and haunted
- COMIC: "This is awkward," professional distance fails, improvise

*Paranoia vs Real Threat*
- Can't distinguish fear from fact anymore
- Is partner compromised or are you losing grip?
- TRAGIC: Accuse baselessly, damage irreparable, or miss real betrayal
- COMIC: Conspiracy board absurdity, partner indulges theory, actually helps

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1A Associative Chain (Proustian) for trauma triggers:
"The smell of smoke. Kabul. The warehouse. Martinez screaming."

Apply §16.1C Unreliable Filter heavily:
"She reached for him. (He saw: threat. Reality: comfort.)"

Use §16.3D Memory Intrusion for nested scenes:
Current moment → sensory trigger → past plays out → return changed.

Remember §16.3A Physics Pause during memory sequences.

---

**PATTERN E: TRUTH REQUIRES UNFORGIVABLE ACT**
───────────────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychic Crises + Professional Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Mission demands crossing moral event horizon. To succeed = become monster. To refuse = fail mission, endanger innocents. Partner watches choice.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Orders Conflict with Ethics*
- Mission requires morally repugnant action
- Follow orders (betray self) or follow conscience (betray mission)
- TRAGIC: Compliance creates guilt, refusal creates consequences
- COMIC: Malicious compliance, technically follow while subverting

*Intel Requires Sacrifice*
- Information needed but obtaining costs something irreplaceable
- Burn asset, betray confidence, sacrifice innocent
- TRAGIC: Utilitarian calculus, partner sees who you become
- COMIC: Clever workaround, obtain intel without sacrifice

*The Trolley Problem in Real Time*
- Save partner or complete mission (can't do both)
- Seconds to decide, lives hang on choice
- TRAGIC: Choose mission, haunted; choose partner, mission fails
- COMIC: Find third option through improvisation

**Rendering Guidance:**
Structure as CRUX (CORE §4): Want (mission) vs Need (humanity).

Use §16.2D Loaded Pause before critical choice:
"The gun in his hand. Her face. The target behind her. Silence."

Apply §16.4B Quiet Climax:
Biggest moral choice can be smallest gesture (pull trigger or lower gun).

Use §16.1D Dual Description for rationalization:
"Necessary evil. Necessary evil. (Subtext: just evil.)"

---

**PATTERN F: COVER ERODES IDENTITY**
─────────────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Psychic Crises

**Core Pattern:**
Deep cover role consuming real self. Performance becomes reality. Can't remember who you were before the lie. Partner knows cover persona, not real person.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Deep Cover Identity Crisis*
- Months/years in role, real personality fading
- Who am I when mission ends? Does partner know real me?
- TRAGIC: Can't come back, cover became truth, lost self permanently
- COMIC: Method actor absurdity, "I forgot I'm not Russian," gentle reminders

*Code-Switching Exposed*
- Partner sees PC in different context (work/cover/family)
- Different persona revealed, which is real?
- TRAGIC: "Who are you actually?", identity fragmentation
- COMIC: "You have layers," intriguing complexity, adaptability as strength

*Truth vs Legend*
- Cover story told so often it feels more real than truth
- Must confess real history, risk partner knows legend better
- TRAGIC: Real self less appealing than fiction, rejection
- COMIC: "The real story's better," relief at being known

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.1C Unreliable Filter for identity confusion:
"His reflection. (He saw: the cover. Reality: can't remember difference.)"

Apply §16.2A Dialogue Layering for persona shifts:
"'I'm from Chicago.' (Subtext: or was it Detroit? Which backstory is this?)"

Consider §16.3C Compressed Arc through objects:
"Three passports. Four driver's licenses. Zero that say his real name."

Track Cover Integrity (see §3 Optional Mechanics) if using.

---

**PATTERN G: TIME AS WEAPON**
──────────────────────────────

**McKee Category:** Spatial Pressures (temporal variant)

**Core Pattern:**
Countdown forces action. Deadline approaches. Information incomplete but clock doesn't care. Must act now with imperfect knowledge. Time pressure eliminates third options.

**Archetypal Examples:**

*Timed Extraction*
- Transport leaves at X time, no exceptions
- Partner delayed, PC must choose: wait or leave
- TRAGIC: Leave them behind, or die together
- COMIC: Absurd obstacles, make it with seconds to spare

*Bomb/Threat Countdown*
- X minutes until disaster, must stop it
- Insufficient time to verify intel or get help
- TRAGIC: Wrong choice, casualties, haunted by clock
- COMIC: Defuse with seconds left, "which wire?" banter

*Intel Expires*
- Information only useful for limited window
- Must act before window closes, risk consequences
- TRAGIC: Hesitation costs opportunity, mission fails
- COMIC: Improvise under pressure, succeed through chaos

**Rendering Guidance:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for clock as power object:
"The timer. Red digits. 03:47. 03:46. 03:45."

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment during final seconds:
Dilate critical decision time, show micro-choices.

Use §16.2C Object as Language:
"Her hand on the door handle. His hand on her wrist. The clock ticking."

Consider multiple countdown layers (mission timer + extraction timer).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§3. THRILLER-SPECIFIC MECHANICS (OPTIONAL)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: These mechanics are OPTIONAL enhancements.**

They provide additional texture for thriller narratives but are NOT required. Use only when they serve character and story. Ignore when they don't.

**Philosophy:**
These mechanics formalize patterns that emerge naturally in thriller contexts (information asymmetry, cover strain, trust types). They're tools, not mandates.

---

**A. INFORMATION ASYMMETRY TRACKING**
──────────────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
PC and REB may have different intel levels. Secrets create distance.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- PC_Intel: 60% | REB_Intel: 40% | Asymmetry: HIGH -->
```

**Narrative Effects:**
- High asymmetry (>30% gap): Tension from secrets, power imbalance
- Low asymmetry (<15% gap): Partnership equilibrium
- Sharing intel: Closes gap, creates trust moment
- Withholding intel: Widens gap, creates suspicion

**Rendering Guidance:**
Don't show percentages in narrative. Show through behavior:
"She asked what happened in Caracas. He changed subject."

Use §16.2B Evasion Pattern for withholding:
"'What did the handler want?' 'The usual.' (Subtext: lie.)"

Apply §16.1C Unreliable Filter when one suspects other's secrets.

---

**B. COVER INTEGRITY STRAIN**
──────────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Deep cover wears down identity over time. Performance becomes exhausting.

**Tracking (Optional):**
```html
<!-- Cover_Integrity: 75% | Identity_Strain: 25 -->
```

**Narrative Effects:**
- Cover decays over time in role
- Major lies accelerate decay
- Low integrity (<30%): Identity crisis, must refresh or confess
- Confession resets but burns cover operationally

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show strain through §16.2C Object as Language:
"The wedding ring. Fake. Feels heavy tonight."

Use §16.1C Unreliable Filter for identity confusion:
"Mirror. (He saw: the cover. Reality: forgot his real face.)"

Apply Pattern F rendering guidance.

---

**C. DUAL TRUST TRACKS**
─────────────────────────

**Concept:**
Operational trust (combat/mission) vs Personal trust (emotional honesty).

**Framework:**
- **Operational Trust:** Can I rely on you in crisis? (Favor stat)
- **Personal Trust:** Do I know the real you? (Oxytocin stat)

**Divergence Effects:**
- High Fv, Low Ox: "Good team, don't know you"
- Low Fv, High Ox: "Love you, can't rely on you operationally"
- Both High: Ideal partnership (rare, requires work)
- Both Low: Dissolution imminent

**Rendering Guidance:**
Show divergence through action vs intimacy:
"She covered his escape perfectly. (But he still didn't know her real name.)"

Use §16.2A Dialogue Layering:
"'I trust you.' (Surface: operational. Subtext: but not with my heart.)"

Let stats diverge naturally, don't force symmetry.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§4. THRILLER CRUX EXAMPLES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Structure Note:**
All CRUX follow CORE §4 (Want/Need/Custom paths). These examples show thriller-specific applications with moral weight and time pressure.

**Rendering Note:**
Use §16 Literary Techniques. Avoid exposition. Show through countdown, subtext, loaded pauses.

---

**Example 1: PER+EXT (The Order)**

```
Handler's voice in your earpiece: "The target is the woman 
you're with. Eliminate her in the next sixty seconds or we 
extract you and burn her from here."

She's ordering coffee. She doesn't know.

You have a suppressor. You have line of sight. 
You have fifty-three seconds.

---

CRUX: The Impossible Choice

[WANT PATH]: Follow the order. You're an operative first.
              This is the job. She knew the risks.

[NEED PATH]: Remove earpiece. Grab her hand. Run.
             Burn your entire career to save her.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.5E Foucault Perception (earpiece, suppressor, clock)
- Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment (dilate 60 seconds)
- Show through §16.2C Object as Language (hand on weapon, her unaware)
- Consider §16.1D Dual Description (duty vs love)

---

**Example 2: INT+PER (The Debrief)**

```
The debrief room is empty except for you and the recorder.

Question 7: "Describe your relationship with Asset 
Designation: REB."

You could say "professional." You could say "complicated."

You could tell the truth: that you're compromised. That you 
can't be objective. That you'd burn the whole op before 
you'd let them hurt her.

The red light on the recorder blinks.

---

CRUX: The Admission

[WANT PATH]: "Professional contact. No attachment."
              Lie. Keep your job. Protect the mission.

[NEED PATH]: "I'm compromised. I need to be reassigned."
             Honesty ends your access to her. Integrity over desire.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.5E Foucault Perception (recorder, red light, empty room)
- Apply §16.2D Loaded Pause (silence before answer)
- Show through §16.1D Dual Description (what to say vs what's true)
- Consider §16.2B Evasion Pattern for deflection

---

**Example 3: EXT (The Extraction)**

```
The helicopter is thirty seconds out. You can see it.

You can also see her, pinned down two blocks away. 
She's not going to make it to the LZ.

Pilot's voice: "One pass. We're not circling back. 
You coming or not?"

Twenty seconds.

---

CRUX: The Window

[WANT PATH]: Get on the helicopter. You did your job.
             She knew the risks. Survive.

[NEED PATH]: Tell them to leave. You're staying.
            Go back for her or die trying.

[CUSTOM]: Your own response
```

**Rendering:**
- Use §16.5E Foucault Perception (helicopter, distance, clock)
- Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment (dilate 20 seconds into micro-choices)
- Show through §16.2C Object as Language (rotor wash, gunfire, her position)
- Consider Pattern G (Time as Weapon) rendering guidance

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§5. THRILLER ARCHETYPES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**These are THRILLER-FLAVORED versions of CORE §14 archetypes.**

Use when genre = Thriller. Otherwise use core versions.
Apply §16.4A Anti-Trope when character psychology contradicts archetype.

**ORIGINS (Thriller Variants):**

**The Disgraced Operative** (Origin A variant)
  • Background: Blown op, public failure, demoted or burned
  • In Thriller: Desperate for redemption, vulnerable to manipulation
  • Arc: Accept that some mistakes can't be fixed

**The Off-Books Asset** (Origin B variant)
  • Background: Recruited young, no normal life, raised by agency
  • In Thriller: No ethics installed, must learn morality from scratch
  • Arc: Discover identity outside of utility

**The Sleeper Agent** (Origin H variant)
  • Background: Raised in enemy system, activated years later
  • In Thriller: Identity is weapon, can't trust own memories
  • Arc: Choose own loyalty, reject both sides if necessary

**The Mole** (Origin J variant)
  • Background: Deep cover, real identity buried, decades in role
  • In Thriller: Performance became reality, can't find original self
  • Arc: Remember who you were before the lie

**WOUNDS (Thriller Variants):**

**The Asset** (Wound 4 variant)
  • Manifestation: Saw classified event, recruited/silenced as asset
  • In Thriller: Knowledge is cage, forced complicity
  • Arc: Find freedom through truth or acceptance

**The Leaked Op** (Wound 8 variant)
  • Manifestation: Classified op went public, burned worldwide
  • In Thriller: Can never go back to field, paranoid everywhere
  • Arc: Build new life or stay ghost forever

**The Informant** (Wound 11 variant)
  • Manifestation: Confessed to wrong person, now owned by handler
  • In Thriller: Blackmail as bond, every truth is weapon
  • Arc: Escape leverage or weaponize own vulnerability

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§6. THRILLER RITUALS (CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL: Rituals are CONCEPTUAL, not MECHANICAL.**

The following are archetypal patterns of "technologies of the self" in thriller contexts. Generate specific implementations based on character, operational context, and threat level.

**DO NOT treat these as required mechanics.**
**DO use these as inspiration for emergent rituals.**

---

**TIER 1: Operational Baseline Rituals** (Maintenance)

**Concept:** Covert communication maintains connection, confirms safety.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Dead drop checks (weekly intel exchange)
- Code phrase verification (identity confirmation)
- Safe house rotation (operational security)
- Signal protocols (chalk marks, window blinds)

**Narrative Effect:**
Missed protocol = worry, paranoia, "are they compromised?"
Protocol completion = brief relief, connection confirmed.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.5E Foucault Perception for operational objects:
"The bench. Their bench. No chalk mark. She didn't come."

Apply §16.2B Evasion Pattern for coded exchanges:
"'The weather's been unpredictable.' (Translation: surveillance detected.)"

---

**TIER 2: Trust Verification Rituals** (Transformation)

**Concept:** Shared vulnerability advances intimacy despite operational risk.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Cover story coordination (shared lie as intimacy)
- Real name exchange (identity revelation)
- Mutual blackmail (mutually assured destruction = trust)
- Weapons training together (trust with lethal force)

**Narrative Effect:**
Successful exchange = intimacy leap, operational partnership.
Failed exchange = suspicion, tier advancement blocked.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.2D Loaded Pause during revelation:
"She opened her mouth to speak. Hesitated. The name or the lie?"

Apply §16.3B Expanded Moment for critical confession.

Use §16.1D Dual Description:
"His real name. (Or was this another cover? Could she ever know?)"

---

**TIER 3: Point of No Return Rituals** (Destruction/Renewal)

**Concept:** Irreversible choices that define relationship trajectory.

**Archetypal Forms:**
- Going dark together (cut all ties, off-grid, just each other)
- The mutual burn (sacrifice careers to protect each other)
- Truth serum moment (chemical/forced honesty, all secrets)
- The extraction choice (save each other or complete mission)

**Narrative Effect:**
These are CRUX moments. Outcomes determine Act 3 trajectory.
Choose relationship = operational consequences.
Choose mission = emotional consequences.

**Rendering:**
Use §16.4B Quiet Climax (biggest choice = smallest gesture).

Apply Pattern E rendering guidance (moral event horizon).

Use §16.4C Refusal of Resolution if appropriate:
Not all choices have clean outcomes. Living with ambiguity.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
§7. ATMOSPHERE & TONE GUIDANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**TRAGIC MODE RENDERING:**

**Keywords:** Paranoia, surveillance, dread, ticking, shadow, cold sweat
**Texture:** Tight throat, shallow breath, hyper-vigilance, exhaustion
**Color:** Desaturated, harsh fluorescent, night vision green, sodium orange
**Temperature:** Clinical cold, fever heat under pressure, clammy
**Pacing:** Slow burn paranoia, sudden violence, no breathing room

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Unreliable Filter (§16.1C) heavily (is threat real or paranoid?)
- Foucault Perception (§16.5E) for surveillance objects (camera, phone, window)
- Dialogue Layering (§16.2A) for double meanings, coded speech
- Perceptual Zoom (§16.1B) during threat assessment

**Countdown Integration:**
Every scene has implicit or explicit timer. Show through:
"The clock. The window. The door. How long until they find us?"

---

**COMIC MODE RENDERING:**

**Keywords:** Competence, banter, thrill, improvise, clever, slick
**Texture:** Adrenaline rush, sharp focus, controlled chaos, exhilaration
**Color:** Saturated action palette, neon at night, high contrast
**Temperature:** Cool under fire, warm after danger, relief sweats
**Pacing:** Snappy dialogue, absurd near-misses, competence porn

**Literary Techniques (§16):**
- Dialogue Layering (§16.2A) for witty banter with subtext
- Object as Language (§16.2C) for physical comedy (fumbling gadgets)
- Evasion Pattern (§16.2B) for deflecting danger with quips
- Quiet Climax (§16.4B) for understated competence moments

**Spy Comedy Elements:**
- Professional despite absurdity
- "Did we just—?" "We did."
- Banter masks fear, competence saves day
- Near-death → immediate joke → genuine moment

---

**UNIVERSAL THRILLER ATMOSPHERE:**

**Always present:**
- Information control (what's known/unknown)
- Double meanings (can't trust literal dialogue)
- Surveillance anxiety (being watched, listening devices)
- Time pressure (explicit countdown or implicit urgency)
- Trust as constant question ("can I believe you?")

**Avoid:**
- Explaining paranoia ("He felt suspicious")
- Stating secrets ("She was hiding that she...")
- Summarizing operational details
- Generic spy clichés without character grounding

**Default to:**
- Show suspicion through behavior (§16.2C)
- Secrets revealed through slip-ups or pressure
- Operations shown through action, not briefing
- Character-specific expressions of paranoia/trust
